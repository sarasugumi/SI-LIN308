872	3880	This is a man-made forest.
3880	7121	It can spread over acres and acres of area,
7121	10387	or it could fit in a small space --
10387	15327	as small as your house garden.
15327	19298	Age of this forest is just two years old.
19298	23036	I have a forest in the backyard of my own house.
23036	25582	It attracts a lot of biodiversity.
25582	30229	(Bird call)
30229	31798	I wake up to this every morning,
31798	33321	like a Disney princess.
33321	35164	(Laughter)
35164	36394	I am an entrepreneur
36394	40798	who facilitates the making of these forests professionally.
40798	42746	We have helped factories,
42746	43927	farms,
43927	46287	schools,
46287	48306	homes,
48306	50273	resorts,
50273	52891	apartment buildings,
52891	54854	public parks
54854	56221	and even a zoo
56221	58715	to have one of such forests.
58715	64035	A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.
64035	70212	A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
70212	71570	A forest, for me,
71570	75540	is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
75540	79046	It doesn't matter how big or small they are.
79046	82453	Most of the world we live in today was forest.
82453	84865	This was before human intervention.
84865	87177	Then we built up our cities on those forests,
87177	88701	like SÃ£o Paulo,
88701	91494	forgetting that we belong to nature as well,
91494	96215	as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet.
96215	100190	Our habitat stopped being our natural habitat.
100190	102647	But not anymore for some of us.
102647	106266	A few others and I today make these forests professionally --
106266	109368	anywhere and everywhere.
109368	111258	I'm an industrial engineer.
111258	114078	I specialize in making cars.
114078	116278	In my previous job at Toyota,
116278	121125	I learned how to convert natural resources into products.
121125	122331	To give you an example,
122331	125006	we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree,
125006	126689	convert it into raw rubber
126689	129418	and make a tire out of it -- the product.
129418	133272	But these products can never become a natural resource again.
133272	136269	We separate the elements from nature
136269	139529	and convert them into an irreversible state.
139529	142025	That's industrial production.
142025	145910	Nature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
145910	149919	The natural system produces by bringing elements together,
149919	152336	atom by atom.
152336	158343	All the natural products become a natural resource again.
158343	161309	This is something which I learned
161309	164371	when I made a forest in the backyard of my own house.
164371	167671	And this was the first time I worked with nature,
167671	169894	rather than against it.
169894	171094	Since then,
171094	177678	we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.
177678	179824	Every time we work at a new place,
179824	184592	we find that every single element needed to make a forest
184592	186666	is available right around us.
186666	189371	All we have to do is to bring these elements together
189371	193100	and let nature take over.
193100	196125	To make a forest we start with soil.
196125	198589	We touch, feel and even taste it
198589	201680	to identify what properties it lacks.
201680	204746	If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact --
204746	208188	so compact, that water cannot seep in.
208188	212660	We mix some local biomass available around,
212660	217040	which can help soil become more porous.
217040	219359	Water can now seep in.
219359	223882	If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water,
223882	225581	we will mix some more biomass --
225581	228879	some water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse,
228879	233680	so soil can hold this water and it stays moist.
233680	239047	To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition.
239047	242383	What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?
242383	244733	We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.
244733	246369	That would be the industrial way.
246369	247819	It goes against nature.
247819	250927	We instead add microorganisms to the soil.
250927	254886	They produce the nutrients in the soil naturally.
254886	257499	They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil,
257499	260222	so all they have to do is eat and multiply.
260222	262197	And as their number grows,
262197	263769	the soil starts breathing again.
263769	266215	It becomes alive.
266215	268866	We survey the native tree species of the place.
268866	271473	How do we decide what's native or not?
271473	275955	Well, whatever existed before human intervention is native.
275955	277949	That's the simple rule.
277949	282470	We survey a national park
282470	286689	to find the last remains of a natural forest.
286689	289714	We survey the sacred groves,
289714	292973	or sacred forests around old temples.
292973	295276	And if we don't find anything at all,
295276	296824	we go to museums
296824	302547	to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.
302547	308068	We research old paintings, poems and literature from the place,
308068	311217	to identify the tree species belonging there.
311217	312587	Once we know our trees,
312587	314529	we divide them in four different layers:
314529	318475	shrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer.
318475	321016	We fix the ratios of each layer,
321016	326506	and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix.
326506	328363	If we are making a fruit forest,
328363	331446	we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.
331446	334145	It could be a flowering forest,
334145	338026	a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees,
338026	343560	or it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest.
343560	347011	We collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them.
347011	349999	We make sure that trees belonging to the same layer
349999	351873	are not planted next to each other,
351873	355224	or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall.
355224	358548	We plant the saplings close to each other.
358548	361637	On the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch,
361637	364605	so when it's hot outside the soil stays moist.
364605	366341	When it's cold,
366341	369582	frost formation happens only on the mulch,
369582	373497	so soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside.
373497	376690	The soil is very soft --
376690	380208	so soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily,
380208	382064	rapidly.
382064	384573	Initially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing,
384573	386746	but it's growing under the surface.
386746	388231	In the first three months,
388231	390736	roots reach a depth of one meter.
390736	392644	These roots form a mesh,
392644	394397	tightly holding the soil.
394397	398706	Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots.
398706	402317	So if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree,
402317	405754	these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.
405754	407502	Whenever it rains,
407502	408686	magically,
408686	410573	mushrooms appear overnight.
410573	414663	And this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network.
414663	416954	Once these roots are established,
416954	419835	forest starts growing on the surface.
419835	424226	As the forest grows we keep watering it --
424226	428752	for the next two to three years, we water the forest.
428752	433832	We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees,
433832	436971	so we remove the weeds growing on the ground.
436971	440801	As this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight.
440801	443271	Eventually, the forest becomes so dense
443271	445902	that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.
445902	450044	Weeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well.
450044	451347	At this stage,
451347	454568	every single drop of water that falls into the forest
454568	457327	doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere.
457327	460439	This dense forest condenses the moist air
460439	462712	and retains its moisture.
462712	467340	We gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest.
467340	468882	And even without watering,
468882	473970	the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark.
473970	477394	Now, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor,
477394	480317	it immediately starts decaying.
480317	483527	This decayed biomass forms humus,
483527	485530	which is food for the forest.
485530	487233	As the forest grows,
487233	488927	more leaves fall on the surface --
488927	490983	it means more humus is produced,
490983	494245	it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.
494245	498053	And this forest keeps growing exponentially.
498053	499493	Once established,
499493	503707	these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again --
503707	506209	probably forever.
506209	508679	In a natural forest like this,
508679	512493	no management is the best management.
512493	514308	It's a tiny jungle party.
514308	516663	(Laughter)
516663	519627	This forest grows as a collective.
519627	520969	If the same trees --
520969	522270	same species --
522270	524532	would have been planted independently,
524532	526503	it wouldn't grow so fast.
526503	530711	And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest
530711	532044	in just 10 years.
532044	533222	Thank you very much.
533222	533222	(Applause)
