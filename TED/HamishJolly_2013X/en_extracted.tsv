1202	2711	Scientific breakthrough,
2711	5324	the kind that can potentially save lives,
5324	7388	can sometimes be lying right out in the open
7388	8950	for us to discover,
8950	11156	in the evolved, accumulated body
11156	13748	of human anecdote, for example,
13748	15774	or in the time-tested adaptations
15774	19236	that we observe in the natural world around us.
19236	21856	Science starts with observation,
21856	25252	but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures
25252	27197	that we might otherwise dismiss
27197	29064	as myth or coincidence,
29064	32917	isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.
32917	36975	And when we do, the results will often surprise.
36975	38855	Western Australia has had a particular problem
38855	42070	with shark attacks over the last three years,
42070	44251	unfortunately and tragically culminating
44251	47331	in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period
47331	49091	during that time.
49091	51220	But Western Australia is not alone in this.
51220	54125	The incident of shark engagements on humans
54125	56469	is escalating worldwide.
56469	58213	And so it's not surprising, perhaps,
58213	59856	that in July of this year,
59856	62335	Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration
62335	65399	with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute
65399	68173	made an announcement which captured the attention
68173	70409	of the worldwide media and of ocean users
70409	72200	worldwide,
72200	73931	and that was around the development of technology
73931	76572	to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack
76572	79720	based on the science of what sharks can see.
79720	81309	And I have for you today
81309	83176	the story of that journey,
83176	85516	but also the notion that science can be
85516	87981	as powerful as a translator
87981	91340	as it can be for invention.
91340	93046	When we began this process,
93046	96228	we were looking, it was about three years ago,
96228	99650	and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks
99650	101421	in Western Australia,
101421	103628	and by chance, in a previous role,
103628	106551	I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.
106551	110258	Now Harry Butler, who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist,
110258	112593	had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.
112593	114699	Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,
114699	116610	to the late Steve Irwin.
116610	117921	When I asked him about
117921	121219	what the solution to the problem might be,
121219	122731	the answer was quite surprising.
122731	124606	He said, "Take a black wetsuit,
124606	127371	band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,
127371	129659	and you'll be mimicking the warning systems
129659	131968	of most marine species."
131968	133866	I didn't think about that much at the time,
133866	137456	and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened,
137456	138890	and it caused me to think,
138890	141021	maybe there's some merit to this idea.
141021	142486	And I turned to the web
142486	144741	to see if there might be some clues.
144741	147018	And it turns out the web is awash
147018	149414	with this sort of evidence that supports
149414	150976	this sort of thinking.
150976	152960	So biologically, there are plenty of species
152960	155556	that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,
155556	157258	to either be cryptical in the water
157258	159842	or warn against being attacked,
159842	161955	not the least of which is the pilot fish
161955	164111	which spends a big slab of its life
164111	166390	around the business end of a shark.
166390	169481	On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,
169481	172343	has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,
172343	173965	and anthropologically,
173965	177595	Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands
177595	179376	in a sea snake ceremony
179376	181970	to ward off the shark god.
181970	183412	So what's going on here?
183412	186290	Is this an idea lying wide out in the open
186290	189421	for us to consider and define?
189421	193790	We know that sharks use a range of sensors
193790	197162	when they engage, particularly for attack,
197162	199122	but the sight sensor is the one that they use
199122	200686	to identify the target, and particularly
200686	204420	in the last number of meters before the attack.
204420	207378	It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote
207378	209230	because that's time-tested evolution
209230	211703	over many millennia.
211703	215180	But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,
215180	216911	the idea that there's a kernel of truth
216911	218503	thought to be important,
218503	221788	passed down from generation to generation,
221788	225103	so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?
225103	226763	I wanted to test this idea.
226763	227981	I wanted to put some science
227981	230317	to this anecdotal evidence,
230317	232273	because if science could support this concept,
232273	234368	then we might have at least part of the solution
234368	237426	to shark attack right under our very nose.
237426	239221	To do that, I needed some experts
239221	241074	in shark vision and shark neurology,
241074	242883	and a worldwide search, again,
242883	244322	led to the University of W.A.
244322	246725	on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.
246725	249322	And professor Nathan Hart and his team
249322	251982	had just written a paper which tells us,
251982	254334	confirms that predatory sharks see
254334	257197	in black and white, or grayscale.
257197	259000	So I called up Nathan,
259000	260866	a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea
260866	262747	that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes
262747	266253	to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack,
266253	268425	and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.
268425	270887	So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research
270887	273511	supported by the West Australian State Government.
273511	276070	And we did three key things.
276070	278790	The first is that we mapped the characteristics,
278790	280810	the physical characteristics of the eyes
280810	282748	of the three main predatory sharks,
282748	286466	so the great white, tiger and bull shark.
286466	288020	We did that genetically
288020	290920	and we did that anatomically.
290920	292762	The next thing we did was to understand,
292762	294197	using complex computer modeling,
294197	296251	what that eye can see
296251	298020	at different depths, distances,
298020	302261	light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.
302261	303451	And from there, we were able to pinpoint
303451	305251	two key characteristics:
305251	308284	what patterns and shapes would present the wearer
308284	311516	as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,
311516	313012	and what patterns and shapes might provide
313012	315933	the greatest contrast but provide the greatest
315933	317390	breakup of profile
317390	321034	so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey
321034	323387	or shark food.
323387	325579	The next thing we needed to do was to convert this
325579	328328	into wetsuits that people might actually wear,
328328	330950	and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,
330950	334180	a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,
334180	336542	and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo,
336542	338827	to come over and sit with the science team
338827	342423	and interpret that science
342423	345565	into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear.
345565	348021	And here's an example of one of the first drawings.
348021	351025	So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.
351025	355294	So this takes that banding idea,
355294	357880	takes that banding idea, it's highly visible,
357880	359885	provides a highly disruptive profile,
359885	361712	and is intended to prevent the shark
361712	364380	from considering that you would be ordinary food,
364380	367726	and potentially even create confusion for the shark.
367726	371501	And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.
371501	374114	You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,
374114	376841	and it's particularly better for the surface,
376841	379689	where being backlit and providing a silhouette
379689	381301	is problematic.
381301	384209	Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,
384209	385820	or the one which attempts to hide the wearer
385820	387310	in the water column.
387310	389000	There are three panels on this suit,
389000	390624	and in any given conditions,
390624	391979	one or more of those panels
391979	394569	will match the reflective spectra of the water
394569	397168	so as to disappear fully or partially,
397168	399360	leaving the last panel or panels
399360	402247	to create a disruptive profile in the water column.
402247	404412	And this one's particularly well-suited
404412	406859	to the dive configuration,
406859	409927	so when you're deeper under the water.
409927	411637	So we knew that we had
411637	413407	some really solid science here.
413407	415033	We knew, if you wanted to stand out,
415033	416205	you needed to look stripy,
416205	417629	and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,
417629	419181	you needed to look like this.
419181	421007	But the acid test is always going to be,
421007	422339	how would sharks really behave
422339	425070	in the context of these patterns and shapes.
425070	428381	And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit
428381	429929	in the water with a predatory shark
429929	431295	in a natural environment
431295	433247	is actually a lot harder than you might think.
433247	436598	(Laughter)
436598	439164	So we have to bait the rig,
439164	440708	because we need to get the statistical number
440708	443732	of samples through to get the scientific evidence,
443732	444521	and by baiting the rig,
444521	446750	we're obviously changing shark behavior.
446750	448567	We can't put humans in the water.
448567	451453	We're ethically precluded from even using
451453	454100	humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.
454100	456372	But nevertheless, we started the testing process
456372	458220	in January of this year,
458220	459356	initially with tiger sharks
459356	462695	and subsequently with great white sharks.
462695	464130	The way we did that
464130	468885	was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,
468885	470781	wrap it in a neoprene skin,
470781	473344	and then run two stereo underwater cameras
473344	476693	to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig.
476693	478381	And because we use stereo,
478381	481173	we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is,
481173	483429	what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,
483429	485285	and what its behavior is
485285	488491	in an empirical rather than a subjective way.
488491	490979	Because we needed to preserve the scientific method,
490979	492677	we ran a control rig
492677	496389	which was a black neoprene rig
496389	498198	just like a normal black wetsuit
498198	499677	against the, what we call,
499677	501805	SAMS technology rig.
501805	504533	And the results were not just exciting,
504533	505971	but very encouraging,
505971	508519	and today I would like to just give you a snapshot
508519	512181	of two of those engagements.
512181	514301	So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark
514301	517388	engaging the black control rig,
517388	518729	which it had encountered about
518729	539780	a minute and a half before.
539780	542210	Now that exact same shark had engaged,
542210	544040	or encountered this SAMS rig,
544040	545652	which is the Elude SAMS rig,
545652	546831	about eight minutes before,
546831	549974	and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,
549974	552779	looking for what it could smell and sense but not see,
552779	557734	and this was the final engagement.
557734	560687	Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers,
560687	562735	and here you see great white shark
562735	564142	engaging a control rig,
564142	565975	so a black neoprene wetsuit,
565975	567559	and going straight to the bottom,
567559	570110	coming up
570110	574257	and engaging.
574257	576940	In contrast to the SAMS technology rig,
576940	578409	this is the banded one,
578409	580350	where it's more tactile,
580350	581860	it's more investigative,
581860	583494	it's more apprehensive,
583494	596297	and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.
596297	606601	(Applause)
606601	610877	So, it's important for us that all the testing is done independently,
610877	613195	and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.
613195	614947	It'll be an ongoing process.
614947	617356	It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.
617356	619699	It's so important that this concept
619699	621497	is led with the science.
621497	623741	From the perspective of Shark Attack Mitigation Systems,
623741	626146	we're a biotechnology licensing company,
626146	628433	so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.
628433	630713	We'll license others to do that.
630713	631672	But I thought you might be interested
631672	633673	in seeing what SAMS technology looks like
633673	636672	embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,
636672	639888	for the first time, live, worldwide --
639888	641862	(Laughter) —
641862	644758	I can show you what biological adaptation,
644758	648285	science and design looks like in real life.
648285	650182	So I can welcome Sam, the surfer,
650182	652890	from this side. Where are you, Sam?
652890	654686	(Applause)
654686	656356	And Eduardo.
656356	658172	(Applause)
658172	660866	Cheers, mate.
660866	662956	Cheers.
662956	669656	Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause)
669656	670943	So what have we done here?
670943	673960	Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet
673960	677280	and use science as a tool for invention,
677280	680136	we've paid attention to the biological evidence,
680136	681826	we've put importance to the
681826	683536	human anecdotal evidence,
683536	686618	and we've used science as a tool
686618	688021	for translation,
688021	690248	translation of something that was already there
690248	693819	into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind.
693819	695743	And it strikes me that this idea of science
695743	698799	as a tool for translation rather than invention
698799	701463	is one that we can apply much more widely than this
701463	703410	in the pursuit of innovation.
703410	705735	After all, did the Wright brothers
705735	707787	discover manned flight,
707787	710976	or did they observe the biological fact of flight
710976	714168	and translate that mechanically, replicate it
714168	716685	in a way that humans could use?
716685	718219	As for the humble wetsuit,
718219	720160	who knows what oceanwear will look like
720160	723111	in two years' time, in five years' time
723111	726203	or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,
726203	727469	I'm guessing there's a fair chance
727469	729190	it won't be pure black.
729190	731359	Thank you.
731359	731359	(Applause)
