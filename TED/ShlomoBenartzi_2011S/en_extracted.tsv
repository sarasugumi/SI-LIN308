0	3000	I'm going to talk today about saving more,
3000	6000	but not today, tomorrow.
6000	8000	I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.
8000	10000	It's a program that Richard Thaler
10000	12000	from the University of Chicago and I
12000	15000	devised maybe 15 years ago.
15000	17000	The program, in a sense,
17000	19000	is an example of behavioral finance
19000	21000	on steroids --
21000	24000	how we could really use behavioral finance.
24000	27000	Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?
27000	30000	So let's think about how we manage our money.
30000	33000	Let's start with mortgages.
33000	35000	It's kind of a recent topic,
35000	37000	at least in the U.S.
37000	39000	A lot of people buy
39000	42000	the biggest house they can afford,
42000	45000	and actually slightly bigger than that.
45000	48000	And then they foreclose.
48000	50000	And then they blame the banks
50000	53000	for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.
53000	55000	Let's also think about
55000	57000	how we manage risks --
57000	59000	for example, investing in the stock market.
59000	62000	Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,
62000	64000	markets did well.
64000	67000	We were risk takers, of course.
67000	69000	Then market stocks seize
69000	71000	and we're like, "Wow.
71000	74000	These losses, they feel, emotionally,
74000	77000	they feel very different
77000	80000	from what we actually thought about it
80000	82000	when markets were going up."
82000	85000	So we're probably not doing a great job
85000	87000	when it comes to risk taking.
87000	90000	How many of you have iPhones?
90000	93000	Anyone? Wonderful.
93000	96000	I would bet many more of you
96000	99000	insure your iPhone --
99000	102000	you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.
102000	104000	What if you lose your iPhone?
104000	106000	What if you do this?
106000	108000	How many of you have kids?
108000	110000	Anyone?
110000	112000	Keep your hands up
112000	115000	if you have sufficient life insurance.
115000	117000	I see a lot of hands coming down.
117000	119000	I would predict,
119000	121000	if you're a representative sample,
121000	123000	that many more of you
123000	126000	insure your iPhones than your lives,
126000	128000	even when you have kids.
128000	131000	We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.
131000	135000	The average American household
135000	138000	spends 1,000 dollars a year
138000	140000	on lotteries.
140000	143000	And I know it sounds crazy.
143000	146000	How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?
146000	148000	No one.
148000	151000	So that tells us that the people not in this room
151000	153000	are spending more than a thousand
153000	156000	to get the average to a thousand.
156000	158000	Low-income people
158000	162000	spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.
162000	164000	So where does it take us?
164000	167000	We're not doing a great job managing money.
167000	170000	Behavioral finance is really a combination
170000	172000	of psychology and economics,
172000	174000	trying to understand
174000	176000	the money mistakes people make.
176000	178000	And I can keep standing here
178000	182000	for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left
182000	184000	and make fun of all sorts of ways
184000	186000	we manage money,
186000	189000	and at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?"
189000	192000	And that's what I really want to focus on today.
192000	194000	How do we take an understanding
194000	197000	of the money mistakes people make,
197000	200000	and then turning the behavioral challenges
200000	202000	into behavioral solutions?
202000	204000	And what I'm going to talk about today
204000	206000	is Save More Tomorrow.
206000	208000	I want to address the issue
208000	210000	of savings.
210000	212000	We have on the screen
212000	214000	a representative sample
214000	216000	of 100 Americans.
216000	219000	And we're going to look at their saving behavior.
219000	221000	First thing to notice is,
221000	223000	half of them
223000	225000	do not even have access
225000	227000	to a 401(k) plan.
227000	230000	They cannot make savings easy.
230000	233000	They cannot have money go away from their paycheck
233000	235000	into a 401(k) plan
235000	237000	before they see it,
237000	239000	before they can touch it.
239000	242000	What about the remaining half of the people?
242000	245000	Some of them elect not to save.
245000	247000	They're just too lazy.
247000	250000	They never get around to logging into a complicated website
250000	253000	and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.
253000	255000	And then they have to decide how they're going to invest
255000	257000	in their 52 choices,
257000	261000	and they never heard about what is a money market fund.
261000	263000	And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.
263000	268000	How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?
268000	271000	One third of Americans.
271000	273000	Two thirds are not saving now.
273000	275000	Are they saving enough?
275000	277000	Take out those
277000	279000	who say they save too little.
279000	281000	One out of 10
281000	284000	are saving enough.
284000	286000	Nine out of 10
286000	289000	either cannot save through their 401(k) plan,
289000	292000	decide not to save -- or don't decide --
292000	295000	or save too little.
295000	297000	We think we have a problem
297000	299000	of people saving too much.
299000	301000	Let's look at that.
301000	303000	We have one person --
303000	306000	well, actually we're going to slice him in half
306000	309000	because it's less than one percent.
309000	312000	Roughly half a percent of Americans
312000	317000	feel that they save too much.
317000	319000	What are we going to do about it?
319000	321000	That's what I really want to focus on.
321000	323000	We have to understand
323000	325000	why people are not saving,
325000	327000	and then we can hopefully flip
327000	329000	the behavioral challenges
329000	331000	into behavioral solutions,
331000	334000	and then see how powerful it might be.
334000	336000	So let me divert for a second
336000	338000	as we're going to identify the problems,
338000	341000	the challenges, the behavioral challenges,
341000	343000	that prevent people from saving.
343000	347000	I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.
347000	350000	Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.
350000	352000	And during the break
352000	354000	there would be a snack
354000	356000	and you could choose bananas or chocolate.
356000	359000	How many of you think you would like to have bananas
359000	361000	during this hypothetical TED event next week?
361000	363000	Who would go for bananas?
363000	365000	Wonderful.
365000	367000	I predict scientifically
367000	370000	74 percent of you will go for bananas.
370000	375000	Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.
375000	378000	And then count down the days
378000	383000	and see what people ended up eating.
383000	386000	The same people that imagined themselves
386000	388000	eating the bananas
388000	390000	ended up eating chocolates
390000	392000	a week later.
392000	394000	Self-control
394000	397000	is not a problem in the future.
397000	399000	It's only a problem now
399000	403000	when the chocolate is next to us.
403000	406000	What does it have to do with time and savings,
406000	409000	this issue of immediate gratification?
409000	413000	Or as some economists call it, present bias.
413000	415000	We think about saving. We know we should be saving.
415000	418000	We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.
418000	420000	Christmas is coming,
420000	423000	we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.
423000	427000	So this issue of present bias
427000	429000	causes us to think about saving,
429000	431000	but end up spending.
431000	433000	Let me now talk
433000	435000	about another behavioral obstacle to saving
435000	437000	having to do with inertia.
437000	439000	But again, a little diversion
439000	442000	to the topic of organ donation.
442000	445000	Wonderful study comparing different countries.
445000	448000	We're going to look at two similar countries,
448000	451000	Germany and Austria.
451000	453000	And in Germany,
453000	455000	if you would like to donate your organs --
455000	457000	God forbid something really bad
457000	459000	happens to you --
459000	462000	when you get your driving license or an I.D.,
462000	464000	you check the box saying,
464000	466000	"I would like to donate my organs."
466000	468000	Not many people like checking boxes.
468000	470000	It takes effort. You need to think.
470000	473000	Twelve percent do.
473000	476000	Austria, a neighboring country,
476000	478000	slightly similar, slightly different.
478000	480000	What's the difference?
480000	482000	Well, you still have choice.
482000	484000	You will decide
484000	487000	whether you want to donate your organs or not.
487000	489000	But when you get your driving license,
489000	491000	you check the box
491000	495000	if you do not want to donate your organ.
495000	497000	Nobody checks boxes.
497000	499000	That's kind of too much effort.
499000	502000	One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.
502000	504000	Doing nothing is very common.
504000	507000	Not many people check boxes.
507000	509000	What are the implications
509000	511000	to saving lives
511000	514000	and having organs available?
514000	516000	In Germany, 12 percent check the box.
516000	519000	Twelve percent are organ donors.
519000	521000	Huge shortage of organs,
521000	523000	God forbid, if you need one.
523000	526000	In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.
526000	529000	Therefore, 99 percent of people
529000	531000	are organ donors.
531000	533000	Inertia, lack of action.
533000	535000	What is the default setting
535000	537000	if people do nothing,
537000	540000	if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?
540000	542000	Very powerful.
542000	544000	We're going to talk
544000	548000	about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared
548000	551000	to make their 401(k) choices.
551000	554000	Are we going to make them automatically join the plan,
554000	556000	or are they going to be left out?
556000	559000	In too many 401(k) plans,
559000	561000	if people do nothing,
561000	564000	it means they're not saving for retirement,
564000	566000	if they don't check the box.
566000	569000	And checking the box takes effort.
569000	572000	So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.
572000	575000	One more before we flip the challenges into solutions,
575000	577000	having to do with monkeys and apples.
577000	579000	No, no, no, this is a real study
579000	583000	and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.
583000	586000	One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.
586000	588000	The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.
588000	590000	They still have an apple left.
590000	593000	They're really mad.
593000	596000	Why have you taken our apple?
596000	599000	This is the notion of loss aversion.
599000	601000	We hate losing stuff,
601000	604000	even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.
604000	607000	You would hate to go to the ATM,
607000	609000	take out 100 dollars
609000	611000	and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.
611000	613000	It's very painful,
613000	615000	even though it doesn't mean anything.
615000	619000	Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.
619000	623000	So this notion of loss aversion
623000	626000	kicks in when it comes to savings too,
626000	628000	because people, mentally
628000	631000	and emotionally and intuitively
631000	633000	frame savings as a loss
633000	636000	because I have to cut my spending.
636000	638000	So we talked about
638000	640000	all sorts of behavioral challenges
640000	644000	having to do with savings eventually.
644000	647000	Whether you think about immediate gratification,
647000	650000	and the chocolates versus bananas,
650000	653000	it's just painful to save now.
653000	655000	It's a lot more fun
655000	657000	to spend now.
657000	660000	We talked about inertia and organ donations
660000	662000	and checking the box.
662000	664000	If people have to check a lot of boxes
664000	666000	to join a 401(k) plan,
666000	668000	they're going to keep procrastinating
668000	670000	and not join.
670000	672000	And last, we talked about loss aversion,
672000	674000	and the monkeys and the apples.
674000	677000	If people frame mentally
677000	680000	saving for retirement as a loss,
680000	683000	they're not going to be saving for retirement.
683000	685000	So we've got these challenges,
685000	687000	and what Richard Thaler and I
687000	689000	were always fascinated by --
689000	691000	take behavioral finance,
691000	693000	make it behavioral finance on steroids
693000	695000	or behavioral finance 2.0
695000	697000	or behavioral finance in action --
697000	701000	flip the challenges into solutions.
701000	704000	And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution
704000	708000	called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.
708000	710000	How is it going to solve the challenges
710000	712000	we chatted about?
712000	714000	If you think about the problem
714000	716000	of bananas versus chocolates,
716000	719000	we think we're going to eat bananas next week.
719000	722000	We think we're going to save more next year.
722000	725000	Save More Tomorrow
725000	727000	invites employees
727000	729000	to save more maybe next year --
729000	731000	sometime in the future
731000	733000	when we can imagine ourselves
733000	735000	eating bananas,
735000	737000	volunteering more in the community,
737000	741000	exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.
741000	744000	Now we also talked about checking the box
744000	747000	and the difficulty of taking action.
747000	749000	Save More Tomorrow
749000	751000	makes it easy.
751000	753000	It's an autopilot.
753000	757000	Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future,
757000	759000	let's say every January
759000	762000	you're going to be saving more automatically
762000	765000	and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan
765000	767000	before you see it, before you touch it,
767000	769000	before you get the issue
769000	772000	of immediate gratification.
772000	775000	But what are we going to do about the monkeys
775000	777000	and loss aversion?
777000	779000	Next January comes
779000	781000	and people might feel that if they save more,
781000	785000	they have to spend less, and that's painful.
785000	787000	Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.
787000	790000	Maybe we should make people save more
790000	793000	when they make more money.
793000	796000	That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,
796000	800000	they don't have to cut their spending.
800000	802000	They take a little bit
802000	804000	of the increase in the paycheck home
804000	806000	and spend more --
806000	808000	take a little bit of the increase
808000	810000	and put it in a 401(k) plan.
810000	812000	So that is the program,
812000	814000	embarrassingly simple,
814000	816000	but as we're going to see,
816000	818000	extremely powerful.
818000	820000	We first implemented it,
820000	822000	Richard Thaler and I,
822000	825000	back in 1998.
825000	828000	Mid-sized company in the Midwest,
828000	830000	blue collar employees
830000	832000	struggling to pay their bills
832000	834000	repeatedly told us
834000	837000	they cannot save more right away.
837000	840000	Saving more today is not an option.
840000	842000	We invited them to save
842000	845000	three percentage points more
845000	848000	every time they get a pay raise.
848000	851000	And here are the results.
851000	853000	We're seeing here a three and a half-year period,
853000	855000	four pay raises,
855000	857000	people who were struggling to save,
857000	859000	were saving three percent of their paycheck,
859000	861000	three and a half years later
861000	864000	saving almost four times as much,
864000	867000	almost 14 percent.
867000	869000	And there's shoes and bicycles
869000	871000	and things on this chart
871000	873000	because I don't want to just throw numbers
873000	875000	in a vacuum.
875000	878000	I want, really, to think about the fact
878000	880000	that saving four times more
880000	882000	is a huge difference
882000	884000	in terms of the lifestyle
884000	886000	that people will be able to afford.
886000	888000	It's real.
888000	891000	It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.
891000	893000	Whereas with saving three percent,
893000	895000	people might have to add nice sneakers
895000	897000	so they can walk,
897000	901000	because they won't be able to afford anything else,
901000	903000	when they save 14 percent
903000	906000	they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes
906000	909000	to walk to the car to drive.
909000	911000	This is a real difference.
911000	916000	By now, about 60 percent of the large companies
916000	919000	actually have programs like this in place.
919000	922000	It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.
922000	924000	And needless to say that Thaler and I
924000	927000	have been blessed to be part of this program
927000	929000	and make a difference.
929000	931000	Let me wrap
931000	934000	with two key messages.
934000	937000	One is behavioral finance
937000	940000	is extremely powerful.
940000	943000	This is just one example.
943000	945000	Message two
945000	947000	is there's still a lot to do.
947000	950000	This is really the tip of the iceberg.
950000	953000	If you think about people and mortgages
953000	956000	and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,
956000	958000	we need to think about that.
958000	961000	If you're thinking about people taking too much risk
961000	964000	and not understanding how much risk they're taking
964000	966000	or taking too little risk,
966000	968000	we need to think about that.
968000	971000	If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year
971000	973000	on lottery tickets,
973000	975000	we need to think about that.
975000	977000	The average actually,
977000	979000	the record is in Singapore.
979000	981000	The average household
981000	984000	spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.
984000	986000	We've got a lot to do,
986000	988000	a lot to solve,
988000	991000	also in the retirement area
991000	993000	when it comes to what people do with their money
993000	995000	after retirement.
995000	997000	One last question:
997000	1000000	How many of you feel comfortable
1000000	1002000	that as you're planning for retirement
1002000	1005000	you have a really solid plan
1005000	1007000	when you're going to retire,
1007000	1010000	when you're going to claim Social Security benefits,
1010000	1012000	what lifestyle to expect,
1012000	1014000	how much to spend every month
1014000	1016000	so you're not going to run out of money?
1016000	1019000	How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future
1019000	1024000	when it comes to post-retirement decisions.
1024000	1027000	One, two, three, four.
1027000	1029000	Less than three percent
1029000	1031000	of a very sophisticated audience.
1031000	1034000	Behavioral finance has a long way.
1034000	1036000	There's a lot of opportunities
1036000	1040000	to make it powerful again and again and again.
1040000	1042000	Thank you.
1042000	1042000	(Applause)
