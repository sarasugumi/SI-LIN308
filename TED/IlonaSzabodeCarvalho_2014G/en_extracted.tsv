817	2993	About 12 years ago,
2993	5245	I gave up my career in banking
5245	8356	to try to make the world a safer place.
8356	12565	This involved a journey into national and global advocacy
12565	17388	and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world.
17388	22566	In the process, I became a civil society diplomat.
22566	26072	Civil society diplomats do three things:
26072	28603	They voice the concerns of the people,
28603	31691	are not pinned down by national interests,
31691	34528	and influence change through citizen networks,
34528	37084	not only state ones.
37084	41683	And if you want to change the world, we need more of them.
41683	44190	But many people still ask,
44190	48741	"Can civil society really make a big difference?
48741	54012	Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy?"
54012	56961	I never thought I would ask myself these questions,
56961	60211	but here I am to share some lessons
60211	65227	about two powerful civil society movements that I've been involved in.
65227	69035	They are in issues that I'm passionate about:
69035	73214	gun control and drug policy.
73214	76859	And these are issues that matter here.
76859	82253	Latin America is ground zero for both of them.
82253	84296	For example, Brazil --
84296	90550	this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record.
90550	96448	We are the number one champion in homicidal violence.
96448	102569	One in every 10 people killed around the world is a Brazilian.
102569	107678	This translates into over 56,000 people
107678	111161	dying violently each year.
111161	117082	Most of them are young, black boys dying by guns.
117082	122213	Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs,
122213	127066	and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here.
127066	130339	Around 50 percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil
130339	133776	are related to the War on Drugs.
133776	139464	The same is true for about 25 percent of people in jail.
139464	144596	And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs.
144596	151620	Virtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble.
151620	155869	Latin America has nine percent of the world's population,
155869	160930	but 25 percent of its global violent deaths.
160930	163972	These are not problems we can run away from.
163972	166271	I certainly could not.
166271	171147	So the first campaign I got involved with started here in 2003
171147	173190	to change Brazil's gun law
173190	176278	and to create a program to buy back weapons.
176278	177857	In just a few years,
177857	180295	we not only changed national legislation
180295	184033	that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun,
184033	189683	but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons.
189683	194262	This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history --
194262	196921	(Applause) --
196921	200542	but we also suffered some setbacks.
200542	206324	We lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in 2005.
206324	209597	The second initiative was also home-grown,
209597	215147	but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime.
215147	216938	I am the executive coordinator
216938	221416	of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy.
221416	223854	The commission is a high-level group
223854	227755	of global leaders brought together to identify more humane
227755	231911	and effective approaches to the issue of drugs.
231911	236479	Since we started in 2008, the taboo on drugs is broken.
236479	241431	Across the Americas, from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,
241431	243579	change is in the air.
243579	247381	But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements,
247381	251189	I just want to share with you four key insights.
251189	254788	I call them lessons to change the world.
254788	257017	There are certainly many more,
257017	260314	but these are the ones that stand out to me.
260314	262496	So the first lesson is:
262496	265770	Change and control the narrative.
265770	267604	It may seem obvious,
267604	270646	but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy
270646	274733	is first changing and then controlling the narrative.
274733	277890	This is something that veteran politicians understand,
277890	282813	but that civil society groups generally do not do very well.
282813	285158	In the case of drug policy,
285158	288618	our biggest success has been to change the discussion
288618	291427	away from prosecuting a War on Drugs
291427	295398	to putting people's health and safety first.
295398	298834	In a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York,
298834	306403	we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market
306403	309724	are criminal gangs and cartels.
309724	313462	So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups,
313462	316434	we need to change the conversation.
316434	322726	We need to make illegal drugs legal.
322726	325559	But before I get you too excited,
325559	328702	I don't mean drugs should be a free-for-all.
328702	332827	What I'm talking about, and what the Global Commission advocates for
332827	337354	is creating a highly regulated market,
337354	342579	where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation.
342579	346619	As for gun control, we were successful in changing,
346619	349544	but not so much in controlling, the narrative.
349544	352400	And this brings me to my next lesson:
352400	356324	Never underestimate your opponents.
356324	358553	If you want to succeed in changing the world,
358553	360922	you need to know who you're up against.
360922	364590	You need to learn their motivations and points of view.
364590	366796	In the case of gun control,
366796	370349	we really underestimated our opponents.
370349	373274	After a very successful gun-collection program,
373274	374618	we were elated.
374618	377454	We had support from 80 percent of Brazilians,
377454	380335	and thought that this could help us win the referendum
380335	382747	to ban gun sales to civilians.
382747	385928	But we were dead wrong.
385928	389249	During a televised 20-day public debate,
389249	393103	our opponent used our own arguments against us.
393103	395332	We ended up losing the popular vote.
395332	397677	It was really terrible.
397677	403836	The National Rifle Association -- yes, the American NRA --
403836	405595	came to Brazil.
405595	408695	They inundated our campaign with their propaganda,
408695	410238	that as you know,
410238	414581	links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy.
414581	418458	They simply threw everything at us.
418458	420385	They used our national flag,
420385	422080	our independence anthem.
422080	423915	They invoked women's rights
423915	429302	and misused images of Mandela, Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.
429302	433272	They won by playing with people's fears.
433272	437916	In fact, guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign.
437916	441213	Their focus was on individual rights.
441213	442792	But I ask you,
442792	445021	which right is more important,
445021	446832	the right to life
446832	449897	or the right to have a gun that takes life away?
449897	454150	(Applause)
454150	457972	We thought people would vote in defense of life,
457972	462756	but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship,
462756	467027	the anti-government message of our opponents resonated,
467027	470626	and we were not prepared to respond.
470626	472715	Lesson learned.
472715	476005	We've been more successful in the case of drug policy.
476005	480719	If you asked most people 10 years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible,
480719	482731	they would have laughed.
482731	486229	After all, there are huge military police prisons
486229	490325	and financial establishments benefiting from this war.
490325	496097	But today, the international drug control regime is starting to crumble.
496097	500926	Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches.
500926	503248	The Global Commission on Drug Policy
503248	505315	really knew its opposition,
505315	507149	and rather than fighting them,
507149	511793	our chair -- former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso --
511793	516065	reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum,
516065	518875	from liberals to conservatives.
518875	523751	This high level group agreed to honestly discuss
523751	525701	the merits and flaws of drug policies.
525701	530461	It was this reasoned, informed and strategic discussion
530461	534222	that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs.
534222	540538	The War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric.
540538	543440	Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever,
543440	546227	and consumption has risen globally.
546227	548409	But even worse,
548409	554980	it also generated massive negative unintended consequences.
554980	558626	It is true that some people have made these arguments before,
558626	560366	but we've made a difference
560366	563378	by anticipating the arguments of our opponents
563378	565484	and by leveraging powerful voices
565484	570374	that a few years ago would probably have resisted change.
570374	574461	Third lesson: Use data to drive your argument.
574461	577456	Guns and drugs are emotive issues,
577456	581357	and as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,
581357	584422	sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions
584422	586512	and get to the facts.
586512	589600	But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try.
589600	591251	Until quite recently,
591251	595265	we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns.
595265	600780	Amazingly, it was a local soap opera called "Mulheres Apaixonadas" --
600780	602498	or "Women in Love" --
602498	606410	that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign.
606410	608872	In one highly viewed episode,
608872	613074	a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet.
613074	617370	Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged,
617370	620644	and in a case of art imitating life,
620644	625938	this episode also included footage of a real gun control march
625938	628422	that we had organized right here, 
628422	631255	outside in Copacabana Beach.
631255	636699	The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion.
636699	641483	Within weeks, our national congress approved the disarmament bill
641483	644571	that had been languishing for years.
644571	647586	We were then able to mobilize data
647586	650886	to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law
650886	653007	and gun collection program.
653007	654769	Here is what I mean:
654769	658293	We could prove that in just one year,
658293	663099	we saved more than 5,000 lives.
663099	666862	(Applause)
666862	669276	And in the case of drugs,
669276	674570	in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue,
674570	679678	we managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies
679678	683549	cause much more harm than drug use per se,
683549	687682	and people are starting to get it.
687682	689818	My fourth insight is:
689818	694044	Don't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows.
694044	696018	What we've learned in Brazil --
696018	698363	and this doesn't only apply to my country --
698363	702995	is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together.
702995	705131	If you want to change the world,
705131	709427	it helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side.
709427	712027	In both the case of guns and drugs,
712027	715463	we brought together a wonderful mix of people.
715463	719667	We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media.
719667	724124	We gathered the victims, human rights champions, cultural icons.
724124	726701	We also assembled the professional classes --
726701	729697	doctors, lawyers, academia and more.
729697	732437	What I've learned over the last years
732437	738337	is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change.
738337	740204	In the case of drugs,
740204	743791	we needed libertarians, anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,
743791	746136	and liberal politicians.
746136	748597	They may not agree on everything;
748597	752846	in fact, they disagree on almost everything.
752846	759521	But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view.
759521	761762	Over a decade ago,
761762	766220	I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank.
766220	770492	I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy
770492	772768	as you can imagine.
772768	774927	But I took a chance.
774927	776924	I changed course,
776924	780284	and on the way, I helped to create social movements
780284	785004	that I believe have made some parts of the world safer.
785004	790178	Each and every one of us has the power to change the world.
790178	794790	No matter what the issue, and no matter how hard the fight,
794790	799504	civil society is central to the blueprint for change.
799504	801815	Thank you.
801815	801815	(Applause)
