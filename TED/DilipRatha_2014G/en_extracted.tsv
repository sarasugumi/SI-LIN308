924	5112	I live in Washington, D.C.,
5112	12479	but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa, in India.
12479	16973	My father was a government worker.
16973	20859	My mother could not read or write, but she
20859	26303	would say to me, "A king is worshipped only in his
26303	32441	own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."
32441	35895	So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.
35895	40077	But I almost didn't go to college
40077	44609	until an aunt offered financial help.
44609	46794	I went to study in Sambalpur,
46794	50989	the largest town in the region,
50989	57988	where, already in college, I saw a television for the first time.
57988	60148	I had dreams of going to the United States
60148	62748	for higher studies.
62748	64877	When the opportunity came,
64877	67212	I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money
67212	73905	for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.
73905	78512	In the U.S., I worked in a research center,
78512	82817	part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.
82817	88151	And with the little I earned, I would
88151	90458	finance myself and then I would send
90458	94916	money home to my brother and my father.
94916	98285	My story is not unique.
98285	102559	There are millions of people who migrate each year.
102559	106340	With the help of the family, they cross oceans,
106340	113155	they cross deserts, they cross rivers, they cross mountains.
113155	117483	They risk their lives to realize a dream,
117483	120156	and that dream is as simple as having a
120156	123467	decent job somewhere so they can send money home
123467	125297	and help the family,
125297	129954	which has helped them before.
129954	135046	There are 232 million international migrants in the world.
135046	136395	These are people who live in a country
136395	139051	other than their country of birth.
139051	140760	If there was a country made up of
140760	142369	only international migrants,
142369	144426	that would be larger, in population,
144426	145863	than Brazil.
145863	147868	That would be larger, in its size
147868	151070	of the economy, than France.
151070	155567	Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,
155567	158718	send money home regularly.
158718	163743	Those sums of money are called remittances.
163743	167730	Here is a fact that might surprise you:
167730	172453	413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars
172453	175486	was the amount of remittances sent last year
175486	178522	by migrants to developing countries.
178522	179806	Migrants from developing countries,
179806	181950	money sent to developing countries â€”
181950	184400	413 billion dollars.
184400	186120	That's a remarkable number because
186120	187985	that is three times the size of
187985	191799	the total of development aid money.
191799	195262	And yet, you and I,
195262	196768	my colleagues in Washington,
196768	198765	we endlessly debate and
198765	201193	discuss about development aid,
201193	205482	while we ignore remittances as small change.
205482	208635	True, people send 200 dollars per month,
208635	212706	on average. But, repeated month after month,
212706	214744	by millions of people,
214744	218811	these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency.
218811	223905	So India, last year, received 72 billion dollars, larger than
223905	226361	its IT exports.
226361	229345	In Egypt remittances are three times
229345	232917	the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.
232917	236729	In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.
236729	239568	And in poorer countries, smaller countries, fragile countries,
239568	244637	conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,
244637	248013	as in Somalia or in Haiti.
248013	250016	No wonder these flows have huge
250016	254916	impacts on economies and on poor people.
254916	258725	Remittances, unlike private investment money,
258725	261752	they don't flow back at the first
261752	263543	sign of trouble in the country.
263543	266428	They actually act like an insurance.
266428	268848	When the family is in trouble,
268848	271453	facing hardship, facing hard times,
271453	273520	remittances increase, they act like an insurance.
273520	276079	Migrants send more money then.
276079	277674	Unlike development aid money,
277674	280251	that must go through official agencies,
280251	283368	through governments, remittances
283368	284993	directly reach the poor,
284993	286311	reach the family,
286311	288865	and often with business advice.
288865	292045	So in Nepal, the share of poor
292045	294873	people was 42 percent in 1995,
294873	297060	the share of poor people in the population.
297060	300662	By 2005, a decade later, at a
300662	303470	time of political crisis, economic crisis,
303470	307839	the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.
307839	311115	That decline in poverty, most of it,
311115	313014	about half of it, is believed to be
313014	315741	because of remittances from India,
315741	317880	another poor country.
317880	322043	In El Salvador, the school dropout
322043	325281	rate among children is lower
325281	327087	in families that receive remittances.
327087	329056	In Mexico and Sri Lanka,
329056	333455	the birth weight of children is higher
333455	338869	among families that receive remittances.
338869	342568	Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.
342568	345289	Migrants send money home for food,
345289	347541	for buying necessities, for building houses,
347541	349929	for funding education, for funding
349929	352658	healthcare for the elderly, for business
352658	354916	investments for friends and family.
354916	357255	Migrants send even more money home
357255	360003	for special occasions like a surgery
360003	363767	or a wedding. And migrants also send
363767	366707	money, perhaps far too many times,
366707	369103	for unexpected funerals that
369103	373001	they cannot attend.
373001	375679	Much as these flows do all that good,
375679	377077	there are barriers to these
377077	378987	flows of remittances, these
378987	381509	400 billion dollars of remittances.
381509	383490	Foremost among them is
383490	387796	the exorbitant cost of sending money home.
387796	389793	Money transfer companies structure
389793	393567	their fees to milk the poor.
393567	396569	They will say, "Up to 500 dollars
396569	398244	if you want to send, we will charge you
398244	400538	30 dollars fixed."
400538	403634	If you are poor and if you have only 200 dollars to send,
403634	406876	you have to pay that $30 fee.
406876	408911	The global average cost of sending
408911	411448	money is eight percent.
411448	412999	That means you send 100 dollars,
412999	414672	the family on the other side receives only
414672	416229	92 dollars.
416229	418013	To send money to Africa,
418013	419596	the cost is even higher:
419596	420942	12 percent.
420942	422916	To send money within Africa,
422916	424400	the cost is even higher:
424400	425719	over 20 percent.
425719	429588	For example, sending money from Benin to Nigeria.
429588	433840	And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,
433840	435321	because of exchange controls,
435321	437321	you send 100 dollars and you
437321	439339	are lucky if the family on the other side
439339	442749	receives even 10 dollars.
442749	445693	Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela
445693	447316	through the official channel.
447316	449440	It all goes in suitcases.
449440	451510	Whereever costs are high,
451510	453893	money goes underground.
453893	455829	And what is worse,
455829	458160	many developing countries actually
458160	460407	have a blanket ban on sending money
460407	462110	out of the country.
462110	464247	Many rich nations also have a
464247	469743	blanket ban on sending money to specific countries.
469743	471854	So, is it that there are no options,
471854	474487	no better options, cheaper options, to send money?
474487	475278	There are.
475278	478998	M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money
478998	481639	and receive money at a fixed cost of only
481639	484536	60 cents per transaction.
484536	487402	U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico
487402	489041	to enable money service businesses
489041	490619	to send money to Mexico
490619	495852	for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.
495852	498807	And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options
498807	501794	can't be applied internationally
501794	504635	because of the fear of money laundering,
504635	507486	even though there is little data
507486	510211	to support any connection, any significant
510211	511883	connection between money laundering
511883	517273	and these small remittance transactions.
517273	518700	Many international banks now
518700	521589	are wary of hosting bank accounts
521589	524990	of money service businesses, especially
524990	527650	those serving Somalia.
527650	530347	Somalia, a country where the
530347	537491	per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.
537491	539907	Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia
539907	542219	is larger than that amount.
542219	544853	Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.
544853	548574	And yet, this is an example of
548574	550445	the right hand giving a lot of aid,
550445	554463	while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood
554463	560064	to that economy, through regulations.
560064	564972	Then there is the case of poor people from villages, like me.
564972	566988	In the villages, the only place where you can
566988	569720	get money is through the post office.
569720	571713	Most of the governments in the world
571713	574729	have allowed their post offices to have
574729	577965	exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.
577965	580787	So, if I have to send money to my
580787	583470	father in the village, I must send money
583470	585773	through that particular money transfer company,
585773	587013	even if the cost is high.
587013	591325	I cannot go to a cheaper option.
591325	593334	This has to go.
593334	595585	So, what can international organizations and
595585	597602	social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost
597602	599231	of sending money home?
599231	605539	First, relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars.
605539	607961	Governments should recognize that
607961	612208	small remittances are not money laundering.
612208	616647	Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships
616647	619641	between their post office and the money transfer company.
619641	621230	For that matter, between the post office
621230	623257	and any national banking system that
623257	626337	has a large network that serves the poor.
626337	629621	In fact, they should promote competition,
629621	632650	open up the partnership so that
632650	635799	we will bring down costs like we did,
635799	639275	like they did, in the telecommunications industry.
639275	642272	You have seen what has happened there.
642272	647075	Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations
647075	649285	should create a remittance platform
649285	650868	on a nonprofit basis.
650868	651940	They should create a nonprofit
651940	654140	remittance platform to serve the money transfer
654140	657869	companies so that they can send money at a low cost,
657869	660020	while complying with all the complex
660020	664732	regulations all over the world.
664732	666134	The development community should
666134	668411	set a goal of reducing remittance costs
668411	671664	to one percent from the current eight percent.
671664	673924	If we reduce costs to one percent,
673924	678193	that would release a saving of 30 billion dollars per year.
678193	682594	Thirty billion dollars, that's larger than the entire
682594	685743	bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.
685743	688759	That is larger than, or almost similar to,
688759	691928	the total aid budget of the United States government,
691928	694784	the largest donor on the planet.
694784	696409	Actually, the savings would be larger
696409	698532	than that 30 billion because remittance channels
698532	703939	are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.
703939	706410	Another major impediment to the
706410	708664	flow of remittances reaching the family
708664	711229	is the large and exorbitant
711229	714207	and illegal cost of recruitment,
714207	717145	fees that migrants pay, migrant workers
717145	720409	pay to laborers who found them the job.
720409	724015	I was in Dubai a few years ago.
724015	726290	I visited a camp for workers.
726290	731603	It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.
731603	733415	Workers were coming back from
733415	735886	their grueling day of work,
735886	737670	and I struck a conversation
737670	740530	with a Bangladeshi construction worker.
740530	743439	He was preoccupied that he is sending
743439	744956	money home, he has been
744956	747866	sending money home for a few months now,
747866	749369	and the money is mostly going
749369	752021	to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent
752021	753664	who found him that job.
753664	757408	And in my mind, I could picture
757408	758589	the wife waiting for
758589	760315	the monthly remittance.
760315	762080	The remittance arrives.
762080	763809	She takes the money and hands
763809	767379	it over to the recruitment agent,
767379	770375	while the children are looking on.
770375	773705	This has to stop.
773705	778521	It is not only construction workers from Bangladesh,
778521	780227	it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant
780227	783178	workers who suffer from this problem.
783178	784855	A construction worker from Bangladesh,
784855	788650	on an average, pays about 4,000 dollars in recruitment fees
788650	794029	for a job that gives him only 2,000 dollars per year in income.
794029	796759	That means that for the two years or three years
796759	800252	of his life, he is basically sending money
800252	801536	to pay for the recruitment fees.
801536	805049	The family doesn't get to see any of it.
805049	808820	It is not only Dubai, it is the dark
808820	811394	underbelly of every major city in the world.
811394	813892	It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,
813892	816047	it is workers from all over the world.
816047	817985	It is not only men.
817985	819870	Women are especially vulnerable to
819870	823408	recruitment malpractices.
823408	828002	One of the most exciting and newest
828002	830420	thing happening in the area of remittances
830420	833461	is how to mobilize, through innovation,
833461	836652	diaspora saving and diaspora giving.
836652	838535	Migrants send money home,
838535	840168	but they also save a large amount of
840168	842613	money where they live.
842613	845248	Annually, migrant savings are estimated
845248	849349	to be 500 billion dollars.
849349	851577	Most of that money is parked in
851577	855302	bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.
855302	858394	If a country were to come and offer a three percent
858394	860905	or four percent interest rate, and then say
860905	863709	that the money would be used for building schools,
863709	866844	roads, airports, train systems
866844	868656	in the country of origin, a lot
868656	870593	of migrants would be interested in
870593	872983	parting with their money because
872983	874778	it's not only financial gains that
874778	876067	give them an opportunity
876067	881539	to stay engaged with their country's development.
881539	883480	Remittance channels can be used
883480	888051	to sell these bonds to migrants
888051	889402	because when they come
889402	890985	on a monthly basis to send remittances,
890985	893566	that's when you can actually sell it to them.
893566	894539	You can also do the same
894539	897320	for mobilizing diaspora giving.
897320	900158	I would love to invest in a
900158	902538	bullet train system in India
902538	905440	and I would love to contribute to efforts
905440	909356	to fight malaria in my village.
909356	913345	Remittances are a great way of
913345	917116	sharing prosperity between places
917116	919412	in a targeted way that benefits
919412	922348	those who need them most.
922348	925506	Remittances empower people.
925506	928614	We must do all we can to make remittances
928614	929599	and recruitment
929599	931751	safer and cheaper.
931751	934862	And it can be done.
934862	936962	As for myself, I have been
936962	940982	away from India for two decades now.
940982	943015	My wife is a Venezuelan.
943015	946913	My children are Americans.
946913	950860	Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.
950860	953190	And yet, I am growing nostalgic
953190	956142	about my country of birth.
956142	961338	I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.
961338	963561	My parents are not there anymore.
963561	967063	My brothers and sisters have moved on.
967063	969597	There is no real urgency for me to send money home.
969597	972219	And yet, from time to time,
972219	975070	I send money home to friends,
975070	977911	to relatives, to the village,
