0	2000	I was raised in Seoul, Korea,
2000	6000	and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
6000	9000	I was pre-med at the time,
9000	12000	and I thought I would become a surgeon
12000	15000	because I was interested in anatomy
15000	19000	and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
19000	24000	At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
24000	28000	I started to realize that I could look at the whole city
28000	30000	as a living organism.
30000	32000	I wanted to dissect it
32000	34000	and look into its unseen layers.
34000	36000	And the way to it, for me,
36000	40000	was through artistic means.
40000	44000	So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
44000	47000	and in grad school I became interested
47000	54000	in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
54000	57000	In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
57000	61000	Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
61000	63000	But I took a liking to them
63000	65000	because they dwell on the fringes of society.
65000	68000	And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,
68000	71000	they're also considered pests.
71000	75000	I also started looking around in the city
75000	78000	and trying to photograph them.
78000	81000	One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks
81000	84000	hoping to catch a rat or two,
84000	87000	and a man came up to me and said,
87000	90000	"You can't take photographs here.
90000	93000	The MTA will confiscate your camera."
93000	96000	I was quite shocked by that,
96000	99000	and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.
99000	102000	I'll follow the rats."
102000	105000	Then I started going into the tunnels,
105000	108000	which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city
108000	113000	that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.
113000	116000	Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals
116000	120000	who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,
120000	122000	guerrilla historians, etc.
122000	126000	I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network
126000	130000	of people who regularly explore urban ruins
130000	133000	such as abandoned subway stations,
133000	136000	tunnels, sewers, aqueducts,
136000	143000	factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
143000	146000	When I took photographs in these locations,
146000	149000	I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
149000	154000	Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures
154000	157000	wasn't enough for me.
157000	161000	So I wanted to create a fictional character
161000	164000	or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,
164000	167000	and the simplest way to do it, at the time,
167000	170000	was to model myself.
170000	173000	I decided against clothing
173000	176000	because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications
176000	178000	or time-specific elements.
178000	182000	I wanted a simple way to represent a living body
182000	189000	inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
189000	193000	This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
193000	196000	It's now an empty, six-acre lot
196000	199000	waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
199000	202000	I was very fond of this space
202000	206000	because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own
206000	208000	that is abandoned.
208000	211000	When I first went in, I was scared,
211000	214000	because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
214000	217000	But they happened to be wild dogs living there,
217000	219000	and it was right by the water,
219000	222000	so there were swans and ducks swimming around
222000	224000	and trees growing everywhere
224000	226000	and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
226000	229000	The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
229000	232000	And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture
232000	237000	to become a part of that nature.
237000	239000	When I got comfortable in the space,
239000	241000	it also felt like a big playground.
241000	244000	I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams
244000	249000	as if I went back in time and became a child again.
249000	253000	This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,
253000	257000	which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
257000	260000	The construction began in 1837.
260000	262000	It lasted about five years.
262000	268000	It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
268000	270000	When you go into spaces like this,
270000	273000	you're directly accessing the past,
273000	276000	because they sit untouched for decades.
276000	281000	I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
281000	284000	Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,
284000	287000	you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks
287000	290000	and shimmying up and down narrow cracks
290000	293000	and getting wet and muddy
293000	297000	and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
297000	301000	This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
301000	304000	It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
304000	307000	The murals were done by a graffiti artist
307000	310000	to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people
310000	313000	that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991
313000	316000	when the tunnel reopened for trains.
316000	318000	Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
318000	321000	There's nobody around you,
321000	324000	and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,
324000	327000	completely unaware of what's underneath.
327000	330000	When I was going out a lot to these places,
330000	333000	I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation
333000	336000	because I was in a solitary phase in my life,
336000	341000	and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"
341000	344000	which references Charles Baudelaire.
344000	347000	"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,
347000	350000	and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia
350000	356000	that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
356000	359000	This is the same tunnel.
359000	362000	You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts
362000	367000	and the train approaching.
367000	371000	This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
371000	374000	I was there alone, setting up,
374000	377000	and a homeless man approached.
377000	380000	I was basically intruding in his living space.
380000	383000	I was really frightened at first,
383000	386000	but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project
386000	388000	and he didn't seem to mind
388000	391000	and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer
391000	393000	and ran back and forth.
393000	396000	And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt
396000	398000	to wipe off my feet
398000	400000	and kindly walked me out.
400000	403000	It must have been a very unusual day for him.
403000	409000	(Laughter)
409000	412000	One thing that struck me, after this incident,
412000	417000	was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
417000	420000	That homeless man, to me, really represented
420000	425000	an element of the unconscious of the city.
425000	428000	He told me that he was abused above ground
428000	431000	and was once in Riker's Island,
431000	435000	and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
435000	440000	The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,
440000	444000	but is now a sanctuary for outcasts,
444000	453000	who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
453000	456000	This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
456000	459000	The tunnels are famous for having been used
459000	465000	during the development of the Manhattan Project.
465000	467000	This particular tunnel is interesting
467000	471000	because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,
471000	473000	which was demolished in 1890
473000	478000	when Columbia moved in.
478000	481000	This is the New York City Farm Colony,
481000	484000	which was a poorhouse in Staten Island
484000	490000	from the 1890s to the 1930s.
490000	493000	Most of my photos are set in places
493000	495000	that have been abandoned for decades,
495000	498000	but this is an exception.
498000	501000	This children's hospital was closed in 1997;
501000	504000	it's located in Newark.
504000	507000	When I was there three years ago,
507000	509000	the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,
509000	511000	but everything was left there as it was.
511000	514000	You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines
514000	516000	and even used utensils,
516000	520000	which you see on the autopsy table.
520000	524000	After exploring recently-abandoned buildings,
524000	527000	I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:
527000	531000	your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church --
531000	535000	any man-made structures around you.
535000	542000	I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is
542000	545000	and how vulnerable people truly are.
545000	548000	I love to travel,
548000	551000	and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
551000	553000	It's full of history,
553000	556000	and also full of underground bunkers
556000	558000	and ruins from the war.
558000	561000	This was taken under a homeless asylum
561000	565000	built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
565000	568000	I saw the structure while I was on the train,
568000	571000	and I got off at the next station and met people there
571000	574000	that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,
574000	578000	which was used for ammunition storage during the war
578000	583000	and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
583000	586000	This is the actual catacombs in Paris.
586000	590000	I explored there extensively
590000	592000	in the off-limits areas
592000	594000	and fell in love right away.
594000	597000	There are more than 185 miles of tunnels,
597000	603000	and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
603000	606000	The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
606000	610000	They were consistently dug as limestone quarries
610000	613000	and by the 18th century,
613000	616000	the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,
616000	621000	so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries
621000	624000	and dug new observation tunnels
624000	627000	in order to monitor and map the whole place.
627000	630000	As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
630000	634000	It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
634000	636000	And at the same time,
636000	640000	there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
640000	645000	So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,
645000	650000	making them into the catacombs.
650000	654000	The remains of over six million people are housed in there,
654000	657000	some over 1,300 years old.
657000	661000	This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery
661000	665000	where most of the ossuaries are located.
665000	670000	There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s
670000	673000	and many bunkers from the World War II era.
673000	676000	This is a German bunker.
676000	679000	Nearby there's a French bunker,
679000	682000	and the whole tunnel system is so complex
682000	685000	that the two parties never met.
685000	688000	The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,
688000	691000	which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
691000	700000	And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
700000	703000	After exploring the underground of Paris,
703000	706000	I decided to climb up,
706000	709000	and I climbed a Gothic monument
709000	715000	that's right in the middle of Paris.
715000	719000	This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
719000	724000	It was built in the early 1500s.
724000	728000	I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
728000	732000	It was not very comfortable. (Laughter)
732000	734000	And all this time,
734000	737000	I never saw a single rat in any of these places,
737000	741000	until recently, when I was in the London sewers.
741000	744000	This was probably the toughest place to explore.
744000	747000	I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes --
747000	750000	I guess, except for in this picture.
750000	753000	And when the tides of waste matter come in
753000	759000	it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
759000	763000	This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
763000	769000	I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
769000	779000	And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.
779000	783000	And this is the first theater project I worked on.
783000	788000	I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
788000	791000	It was performed last September one time only
791000	794000	in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,
794000	799000	which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,
799000	802000	built in 1844.
802000	808000	I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
808000	812000	But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
812000	815000	The last place I visited
815000	818000	was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
818000	823000	This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
823000	829000	I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
829000	835000	I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually
835000	840000	in order to preserve their memories in a creative way --
840000	843000	before they're lost forever.
843000	843000	Thank you.
