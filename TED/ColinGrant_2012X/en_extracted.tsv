937	2633	This is a photograph
2633	5449	of a man whom for many years
5449	9170	I plotted to kill.
9170	12190	This is my father,
12190	15927	Clinton George "Bageye" Grant.
15927	18198	He's called Bageye because he has
18198	22358	permanent bags under his eyes.
22358	25134	As a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,
25134	29250	I dreamt of scraping off the poison
29250	33200	from fly-killer paper into his coffee,
33200	35055	grounded down glass and sprinkling it
35055	38044	over his breakfast,
38044	39754	loosening the carpet on the stairs
39754	43482	so he would trip and break his neck.
43482	45109	But come the day, he would always
45109	47361	skip that loose step,
47361	49190	he would always bow out of the house
49190	51030	without so much as a swig of coffee
51030	53818	or a bite to eat.
53818	55104	And so for many years,
55104	57064	I feared that my father would die
57064	59138	before I had a chance to kill him.
59138	63730	(Laughter)
63730	66721	Up until our mother asked him to leave
66721	68378	and not come back,
68378	72634	Bageye had been a terrifying ogre.
72634	76219	He teetered permanently on the verge of rage,
76219	79827	rather like me, as you see.
79827	83127	He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton
83127	86286	and demanded total silence throughout the house,
86286	88958	so that when we came home from school
88958	90998	at 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle
90998	94248	beside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,
94248	96734	we would twiddle with the volume control knob
96734	99527	on the TV so it was almost inaudible.
99527	101838	And at times, when we were like this,
101838	104270	so much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"
104270	106135	going on in the house
106135	108110	that I imagined us to be like
108110	111610	the German crew of a U-boat
111610	114102	creeping along the edge of the ocean
114102	115918	whilst up above, on the surface,
115918	119663	HMS Bageye patrolled
119663	121790	ready to drop death charges
121790	125777	at the first sound of any disturbance.
125777	128712	So that lesson was the lesson that
128712	130160	"Do not draw attention to yourself
130160	132424	either in the home or outside of the home."
132424	135110	Maybe it's a migrant lesson.
135110	138280	We were to be below the radar,
138280	139775	so there was no communication, really,
139775	142936	between Bageye and us and us and Bageye,
142936	145544	and the sound that we most looked forward to,
145544	147298	you know when you're a child and you want
147298	150736	your father to come home and it's all going to be happy
150736	152490	and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.
152490	153746	Well the sound that we looked forward to
153746	155639	was the click of the door closing,
155639	160347	which meant he'd gone and would not come back.
160347	163806	So for three decades,
163806	166847	I never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.
166847	168615	We never spoke to each other for three decades,
168615	170416	and then a couple of years ago, I decided
170416	174687	to turn the spotlight on him.
174687	176575	"You are being watched.
176575	178431	Actually, you are.
178431	180495	You are being watched."
180495	183159	That was his mantra to us, his children.
183159	184832	Time and time again he would say this to us.
184832	187935	And this was the 1970s, it was Luton,
187935	189564	where he worked at Vauxhall Motors,
189564	191391	and he was a Jamaican.
191391	192450	And what he meant was,
192450	194561	you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant
194561	196479	are being watched
196479	198136	to see which way you turn, to see whether
198136	202255	you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,
202255	204855	of being feckless, work-shy,
204855	207416	destined for a life of crime.
207416	209150	You are being watched,
209150	213493	so confound their expectations of you.
213493	217771	To that end, Bageye and his friends,
217771	219426	mostly Jamaican,
219426	223180	exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:
223180	225794	Turn your best side to the world,
225794	228068	show your best face to the world.
228068	229842	If you have seen some of the images
229842	231978	of the Caribbean people arriving
231978	233630	in the '40s and '50s,
233630	235026	you might have noticed that a lot of the men
235026	236915	wear trilbies.
236915	240556	Now, there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.
240556	243499	They invented that tradition for their arrival here.
243499	245266	They wanted to project themselves in a way
245266	247600	that they wanted to be perceived,
247600	249031	so that the way they looked
249031	251974	and the names that they gave themselves
251974	253646	defined them.
253646	259135	So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.
259135	263147	Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.
263147	265859	Anxious is always anxious.
265859	268588	Clock has one arm longer than the other.
268588	272236	(Laughter)
272236	275610	And my all-time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear.
275610	277444	When Summerwear came to this country
277444	279563	from Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted
279563	281940	on wearing light summer suits,
281940	283596	no matter the weather,
283596	284934	and in the course of researching their lives,
284934	287910	I asked my mom, "Whatever became of Summerwear?"
287910	292737	And she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)
292737	294593	But men like Summerwear
294593	296055	taught us the importance of style.
296055	298177	Maybe they exaggerated their style
298177	301393	because they thought that they were not considered
301393	303497	to be quite civilized,
303497	306313	and they transferred that generational attitude
306313	308913	or anxiety onto us, the next generation,
308913	311100	so much so that when I was growing up,
311100	313473	if ever on the television news or radio
313473	314981	a report came up about a black person
314981	316665	committing some crime —
316665	320329	a mugging, a murder, a burglary —
320329	323881	we winced along with our parents,
323881	326545	because they were letting the side down.
326545	327998	You did not just represent yourself.
327998	329740	You represented the group,
329740	334248	and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,
334248	336512	in a way, that maybe you were going
336512	340656	to be perceived in the same light.
340656	344428	So that was what needed to be challenged.
344428	348709	Our father and many of his colleagues
348709	352170	exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.
352170	354392	They were built to transmit but not receive.
354392	357243	We were to keep quiet.
357243	358596	When our father did speak to us,
358596	361461	it was from the pulpit of his mind.
361461	363049	They clung to certainty in the belief
363049	367178	that doubt would undermine them.
367178	370769	But when I am working in my house
370769	374620	and writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs
374620	377926	and I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley
377926	380790	and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies
380790	383286	and I'm so excited that my children stop me,
383286	386966	and they say, "Dad, nobody cares."
386966	390956	(Laughter)
390956	392870	But they do care, actually.
392870	394433	They cross over.
394433	396940	Somehow they find their way to you.
396940	400544	They shape their lives according to the narrative of your life,
400544	404570	as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,
404570	407184	and maybe Bageye did with his father.
407184	408826	And that was clearer to me
408826	411784	in the course of looking at his life
411784	414840	and understanding, as they say,
414840	416152	the Native Americans say,
416152	417781	"Do not criticize the man until you can walk
417781	420093	in his moccasins."
420093	422992	But in conjuring his life, it was okay
422992	426260	and very straightforward to portray
426260	429240	a Caribbean life in England in the 1970s
429240	434224	with bowls of plastic fruit,
434224	437288	polystyrene ceiling tiles,
437288	439576	settees permanently sheathed
439576	442948	in their transparent covers that they were delivered in.
442948	444800	But what's more difficult to navigate
444800	446292	is the emotional landscape
446292	448262	between the generations,
448262	453000	and the old adage that with age comes wisdom
453000	455045	is not true.
455045	458528	With age comes the veneer of respectability
458528	461896	and a veneer of uncomfortable truths.
461896	464668	But what was true was that my parents,
464668	467144	my mother, and my father went along with it,
467144	469912	did not trust the state to educate me.
469912	472402	So listen to how I sound.
472402	476684	They determined that they would send me to a private school,
476684	478441	but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.
478441	482232	It's quite difficult to fund a private school education
482232	484872	and feed his army of children.
484872	486856	I remember going on to the school
486856	488980	for the entrance exam, and my father said
488980	492580	to the priest — it was a Catholic school —
492580	496807	he wanted a better "heducation" for the boy,
496807	499735	but also, he, my father,
499735	502375	never even managed to pass worms,
502375	504995	never mind entrance exams.
504995	506940	But in order to fund my education,
506940	509663	he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,
509663	512765	so my father would fund my education
512765	516369	by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,
516369	517801	and that was made even more tricky because
517801	519961	my father, that's not his car by the way.
519961	521769	My father aspired to have a car like that,
521769	523845	but my father had a beaten-up Mini,
523845	528343	and he never, being a Jamaican coming to this country,
528343	530696	he never had a driving license,
530696	534260	he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.
534260	536199	He thought, "I know how to drive;
536199	539279	why do I need the state's validation?"
539279	541511	But it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police,
541511	543724	and we were stopped a lot by the police,
543724	544941	and I was impressed by the way
544941	546840	that my father dealt with the police.
546840	549648	He would promote the policeman immediately,
549648	553735	so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs
553735	554919	in the course of the conversation
554919	556903	and wave us on merrily.
556903	558771	So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica
558771	562953	called "playing fool to catch wise."
562953	566322	But it lent also an idea
566322	568128	that actually he was being diminished
568128	570432	or belittled by the policeman —
570432	572249	as a 10-year-old boy, I saw that —
572249	574820	but also there was an ambivalence towards authority.
574820	576465	So on the one hand, there was
576465	578092	a mocking of authority,
578092	580408	but on the other hand, there was a deference
580408	582229	towards authority,
582229	584184	and these Caribbean people
584184	588321	had an overbearing obedience towards authority,
588321	590529	which is very striking, very strange in a way,
590529	593633	because migrants are very courageous people.
593633	596393	They leave their homes. My father and my mother
596393	600320	left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,
600320	604144	and yet they were infantilized by travel.
604144	605912	They were timid,
605912	607361	and somewhere along the line,
607361	609202	the natural order was reversed.
609202	614646	The children became the parents to the parent.
614646	617143	The Caribbean people came to this country with a five-year plan:
617143	619142	they would work, some money, and then go back,
619142	621965	but the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,
621965	624310	and before you know it, you're changing the wallpaper,
624310	627942	and at that point, you know you're here to stay.
627942	630406	Although there's still the kind of temporariness
630406	632853	that our parents felt about being here,
632853	637040	but we children knew that the game was up.
637040	639798	I think there was a feeling that
639798	645148	they would not be able to continue with the ideals
645148	647155	of the life that they expected.
647155	649137	The reality was very much different.
649137	651211	And also, that was true of the reality
651211	652629	of trying to educate me.
652629	656691	Having started the process, my father did not continue.
656691	659419	It was left to my mother to educate me,
659419	662140	and as George Lamming would say,
662140	665919	it was my mother who fathered me.
665919	668261	Even in his absence, that old mantra remained:
668261	669948	You are being watched.
669948	673150	But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,
673150	675399	so much so that years later, when I was investigating
675399	676713	why so many young black men
676713	678844	were diagnosed with schizophrenia,
678844	681351	six times more than they ought to be,
681351	684623	I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,
684623	689081	"Black people are schooled in paranoia."
689081	692952	And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.
692952	695479	Now I also had a 10-year-old son,
695479	698328	and turned my attention to Bageye
698328	699704	and I went in search of him.
699704	703306	He was back in Luton, he was now 82,
703306	706946	and I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,
706946	708544	and when he opened the door,
708544	712448	I saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,
712448	714791	and he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.
714791	717839	I was very disconcerted by that.
717839	720900	But we sat down, and he had a Caribbean friend with him,
720900	723455	talking some old time talk,
723455	725929	and my father would look at me,
725929	727583	and he looked at me as if I would
727583	731227	miraculously disappear as I had arisen.
731227	733463	And he turned to his friend, and he said,
733463	736423	"This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,
736423	739383	deep, deep connection."
739383	740780	But I never felt that connection.
740780	743559	If there was a pulse, it was very weak
743559	746383	or hardly at all.
746383	748223	And I almost felt in the course of that reunion
748223	752840	that I was auditioning to be my father's son.
752840	754832	When the book came out,
754832	756568	it had fair reviews in the national papers,
756568	759840	but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,
759840	762127	it's the Luton News,
762127	765903	and the Luton News ran the headline about the book,
765903	771122	"The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."
771122	774434	And I understood that could also represent
774434	776337	the rift between one generation and the next,
776337	780341	between people like me and my father's generation,
780341	782589	but there's no tradition in Caribbean life
782589	784693	of memoirs or biographies.
784693	788777	It was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public.
788777	793433	But I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,
793433	795329	there is a possibility that this
795329	799522	will open up conversations that we'd never had before.
799522	803726	This will close the generation gap, perhaps.
803726	806253	This could be an instrument of repair.
806253	808654	And I even began to feel that this book
808654	811542	may be perceived by my father
811542	815718	as an act of filial devotion.
815718	819453	Poor, deluded fool.
819453	823494	Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be
823494	826353	the public airing of his shortcomings.
826353	829254	He was stung by my betrayal,
829254	831326	and he went to the newspapers the next day
831326	832510	and demanded a right of reply,
832510	834742	and he got it with the headline
834742	837902	"Bageye Bites Back."
837902	840870	And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.
840870	843748	I was no son of his.
843748	845829	He recognized in his mind that his colors
845829	848197	had been dragged through the mud, and he couldn't allow that.
848197	850782	He had to restore his dignity, and he did so,
850782	853210	and initially, although I was disappointed,
853210	854890	I grew to admire that stance.
854890	858293	There was still fire bubbling through his veins,
858293	861910	even though he was 82 years old.
861910	864472	And if it meant that we would now return
864472	867703	to 30 years of silence,
867703	873663	my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."
873663	876855	Jamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts,
876855	878880	there are only versions.
878880	881361	We all tell ourselves the versions of the story
881361	884216	that we can best live with.
884216	886743	Each generation builds up an edifice
886743	888810	which they are reluctant or sometimes unable
888810	891118	to disassemble,
891118	894764	but in the writing, my version of the story
894764	896832	began to change,
896832	900826	and it was detached from me.
900826	903755	I lost my hatred of my father.
903755	908239	I did no longer want him to die or to murder him,
908239	912483	and I felt free,
912483	917347	much freer than I'd ever felt before.
917347	919227	And I wonder whether that freedness
919227	924218	could be transferred to him.
924218	928570	In that initial reunion,
928570	930946	I was struck by an idea that I had
930946	934390	very few photographs of myself
934390	936764	as a young child.
936764	938954	This is a photograph of me,
938954	941271	nine months old.
941271	943193	In the original photograph,
943193	946146	I'm being held up by my father, Bageye,
946146	948390	but when my parents separated, my mother
948390	951160	excised him from all aspects of our lives.
951160	955224	She took a pair of scissors and cut him out of every photograph,
955224	958766	and for years, I told myself the truth of this photograph
958766	961770	was that you are alone,
961770	964570	you are unsupported.
964570	966842	But there's another way of looking at this photograph.
966842	969418	This is a photograph that has the potential
969418	971922	for a reunion,
971922	974710	a potential to be reunited with my father,
974710	978774	and in my yearning to be held up by my father,
978774	981274	I held him up to the light.
981274	984210	In that first reunion,
984210	986512	it was very awkward and tense moments,
986512	987854	and to lessen the tension,
987854	991192	we decided to go for a walk.
991192	993193	And as we walked, I was struck
993193	995464	that I had reverted to being the child
995464	998957	even though I was now towering above my father.
998957	1001208	I was almost a foot taller than my father.
1001208	1003816	He was still the big man,
1003816	1008537	and I tried to match his step.
1008537	1010114	And I realized that he was walking
1010114	1012890	as if he was still under observation,
1012890	1015801	but I admired his walk.
1015801	1018129	He walked like a man
1018129	1021000	on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final
1021000	1024952	mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.
1024952	1028576	There was dignity in defeat.
1028576	1030993	Thank you.
1030993	1030993	(Applause)
