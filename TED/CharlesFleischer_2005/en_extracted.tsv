0	3000	I am going to be talking about secrets.
3000	5000	Obviously the best way to divulge a secret
5000	8000	is to tell someone to not say anything about it.
8000	10000	(Laughter)
10000	12000	Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year
12000	15000	just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.
15000	16000	(Laughter)
16000	18000	And when you use these things you don't have to go like that.
18000	20000	You just press it.
20000	24000	(Laughter)
24000	27000	Oh, man. Um, yes.
27000	29000	(Laughter)
29000	31000	Yes. I'm sure! Just change it!
31000	36000	(Laughter)
36000	39000	Is Bill Gates here?
39000	41000	Change it! Come on! What?
41000	42000	(Laughter)
42000	44000	Ah! Okay.
44000	46000	That's not my slides, but it's okay.
46000	49000	(Laughter)
49000	52000	As you can see, these are all maps.
52000	56000	And maps are important devices for transferring information,
56000	60000	especially if you have human cognitive ability.
60000	64000	We can see that all formulas are really maps.
64000	66000	Now, as humans, we make maps of places
66000	68000	that we seldom even go,
68000	70000	which seems a little wasteful of time.
70000	74000	This, of course, is a map of the moon.
74000	76000	There're some very delightful names.
76000	79000	Tranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris.
79000	82000	What are these people thinking? Frigoris?
82000	84000	What the Frigoris you doing? Names are important.
84000	87000	Frigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day.
87000	89000	I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.
89000	92000	(Laughter)
92000	94000	There we see Mars, again with various names.
94000	96000	And this is all done, by the way,
96000	98000	by the International Astronomical Union.
98000	101000	This is an actual group of people
101000	104000	that sit around naming planetary objects.
104000	108000	This is from their actual book.
108000	111000	These are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.
111000	114000	I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa.
114000	117000	That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid.
117000	118000	(Laughter)
118000	120000	Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid
120000	123000	doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.
123000	124000	(Laughter)
124000	127000	"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!
127000	129000	It's time for Bolotnitsa!"
129000	132000	(Laughter)
132000	134000	Djabran Fluctus.
134000	137000	If that don't flow off the tongue, what does?
137000	139000	(Laughter)
139000	141000	I mean kids are studying this stuff
141000	143000	and they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong.
143000	144000	(Laughter)
144000	147000	One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.
147000	149000	(Laughter)
149000	152000	"It fluctus up, Mama."
152000	154000	Hikuleo Fluctus.
154000	156000	That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo
156000	160000	sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio
160000	162000	17 syllable thing.
162000	164000	And that's the Tonga underworld.
164000	166000	And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus,
166000	170000	who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets.
170000	173000	Now, if you're a goddess of stars and planets
173000	176000	wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else?
176000	177000	(Laughter)
177000	179000	"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.
179000	182000	Would you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling.
182000	185000	Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.
185000	188000	Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures."
188000	190000	(Laughter)
190000	193000	Now, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do,
193000	195000	it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there
195000	197000	to have to live with these ridiculous names.
197000	199000	So, you'll be on Mars, and you're at
199000	202000	Hellespointica Depressio
202000	204000	which has got to be a really "up" place.
204000	206000	(Laughter)
206000	209000	Yeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis
209000	211000	so I plug it into the Mars map,
211000	213000	and click the button and there's my directions.
213000	215000	I go to Chrysokeras.
215000	218000	(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata.
218000	220000	Then to Niliacus Lacus,
220000	222000	which is not a bad name.
222000	225000	Niliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.
225000	227000	That's a cool name. I will say that.
227000	229000	So, I hold back a little of my venom
229000	231000	for these astronomical misnomers.
231000	233000	And then of course Arnon to Thoth.
233000	235000	And of course there will be advertisements.
235000	238000	This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.
238000	239000	And you know they're international because
239000	242000	they put it "en Francais" as well.
242000	244000	L'Union Astronomique Internationale,
244000	246000	for those of you who don't speak French.
246000	248000	I thought I'd translate for you.
248000	250000	From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.
250000	254000	The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.
254000	256000	And I think that Djabran Fluctus,
256000	258000	that fits that mode.
258000	260000	(Laughter)
260000	262000	That's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple.
262000	264000	Djabran Fluctus.
264000	266000	"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"
266000	270000	"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian?
270000	271000	(Laughter)
271000	273000	It's clear to me."
273000	276000	"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?"
276000	278000	(Laughter)
278000	280000	Also, from the actual document
280000	282000	I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.
282000	285000	Anyone can suggest changing a name.
285000	289000	So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.
289000	292000	We've got to change this stuff up fast.
292000	295000	So, these are actual names of people that work there.
295000	297000	I did some more investigation.
297000	300000	These are more people working for this group.
300000	304000	And, as you can see, they don't use their first names.
304000	305000	(Laughter)
305000	308000	These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.
308000	310000	Something is askew here.
310000	311000	(Laughter)
311000	314000	Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?
314000	316000	(Laughter)
316000	318000	Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba?
318000	319000	(Laughter)
319000	321000	Is that Mars Ya Marov?
321000	324000	I don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.
324000	328000	There are some mapping people who do use their names.
328000	330000	Witness please, Eugene Shoemaker,
330000	332000	who, diligently, from a young boy
332000	335000	decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies.
335000	337000	Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.
337000	339000	"Mom, I want to make maps."
339000	342000	"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto."
342000	344000	"No, I want to make maps of planets."
344000	346000	"Yeah, go to your room."
346000	349000	(Laughter)
349000	351000	Martians, Venusians, Jovians.
351000	356000	We have names for places where people don't exist.
356000	358000	That seems a little silly to me.
358000	360000	There are no Jovians.
360000	362000	Getting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way,
362000	364000	because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights.
364000	366000	(Laughter)
366000	367000	(Applause)
367000	369000	There is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr,
369000	372000	de Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn
372000	374000	or Richard Harris.
374000	376000	(Laughter)
376000	378000	It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.
378000	380000	But obviously the point is that numbers are maps.
380000	384000	And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?
384000	387000	That is the premise of this particular presentation.
387000	390000	By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,
390000	393000	no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.
393000	395000	So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh
395000	399000	to explain my love of this particular planet,
399000	402000	and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.
402000	404000	So, formulas relate number to form.
404000	407000	That's Euler, his formula
407000	410000	was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory
410000	412000	which is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.
412000	414000	(Laughter)
414000	416000	He was also famous for having no body.
416000	419000	(Laughter)
419000	421000	Which a lot of you are like, "How did he figure that out?"
421000	424000	He's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.
424000	426000	Here comes Euler.
426000	428000	(Laughter)
428000	431000	And that's an icosahedron,
431000	434000	which is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.
434000	436000	You see the icosahedron again.
436000	438000	The dodecahedron, it's dual.
438000	441000	There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.
441000	445000	The five sacred solids, as you can see there.
445000	447000	Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.
447000	449000	(Laughter)
449000	451000	Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.
451000	454000	I suggest the house.
454000	456000	The reality, now here is something important.
456000	458000	What's important about this is
458000	460000	these shapes are duals of each other.
460000	462000	And you can see how the icosahedron
462000	464000	withdraws into the dodecahedron
464000	467000	and then they just merge into each other.
467000	469000	So, the whole concept of branes in the universe,
469000	471000	if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron
471000	474000	this is a very good map of what could possibly be.
474000	476000	And that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.
476000	478000	What a coincidence!
478000	482000	October 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet
482000	485000	said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,
485000	488000	based on information that they got from this probe.
488000	490000	This would be a normal wave pattern.
490000	493000	But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches
493000	495000	of the microwave background,
495000	497000	is this kind of odd undulation.
497000	501000	It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.
501000	504000	So, you can kind of get an idea from this
504000	507000	extrapolating that back under this huge picture,
507000	510000	so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.
510000	513000	And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.
513000	515000	(Laughter)
515000	518000	So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.
518000	520000	And for me, that's a win-win.
520000	523000	Everybody goes, I'm happy.
523000	524000	(Laughter)
524000	527000	Better really hurry up.
527000	530000	I just threw this in because
530000	533000	as important as all of our intellectual abilities are,
533000	536000	without heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless.
536000	539000	And that, to me, is really beautiful.
539000	540000	(Laughter)
540000	542000	Except for that creepy guy in the background.
542000	547000	(Laughter)
547000	551000	Getting back to the point of my particular presentation,
551000	553000	Kepler, one of my great heroes,
553000	557000	who realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,
557000	559000	were related somehow to the planets,
559000	561000	but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.
561000	564000	But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.
564000	567000	So, maps of things leading to organized understandings
567000	569000	of the universe in which we emerge.
569000	572000	Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.
572000	575000	(Laughter)
575000	578000	I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters
578000	580000	could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...
580000	581000	(Laughter)
581000	583000	that's not a good picture.
583000	586000	(Laughter)
586000	589000	Not a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis
589000	591000	are a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.
591000	593000	That guy is rockin'.
593000	594000	(Laughter)
594000	596000	What a handsome cat.
596000	598000	Once again, Nicaragua let me down.
598000	600000	(Laughter)
600000	604000	And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.
604000	605000	(Laughter)
605000	607000	I don't get that at all.
607000	609000	Once again, these guys rock it out.
609000	612000	Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.
612000	614000	This is freaky is a major way.
614000	616000	This is Sierra Leone.
616000	619000	They got little babies in there, floating in there.
619000	620000	(Laughter)
620000	622000	Man. I don't really need to comment on this.
622000	625000	But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?
625000	629000	(Laughter)
629000	631000	When did this happen?
631000	632000	(Laughter)
632000	635000	It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?
635000	637000	I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms
637000	640000	that are not necessarily valid.
640000	642000	Although five is a good number, of course.
642000	645000	Ecuador, my friend Kepler,
645000	648000	as you can see, they call him Juan.
648000	650000	(Laughter)
650000	653000	Juan? No! Johannes, not Juan.
653000	656000	It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.
656000	659000	(Laughter)
659000	661000	René Descartes, of course. Once again
661000	663000	these Grenada people, this is like way too sick
663000	665000	for anybody's imagination.
665000	668000	He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,
668000	670000	little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up
670000	672000	fast, ladies and gentlemen.
672000	673000	(Laughter)
673000	677000	This is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.
677000	679000	Once again, that's Sierra Leone.
679000	682000	This is again, indicating how numbers
682000	685000	relate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.
685000	688000	Because that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.
688000	690000	Descartes. (Laughter)
690000	692000	Before the horse. (Laughter)
692000	695000	Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.
695000	698000	Now, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.
698000	700000	Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it.
700000	702000	(Laughter)
702000	704000	And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map
704000	706000	I don't even want to hazard a guess.
706000	709000	But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.
709000	710000	(Laughter)
710000	712000	This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,
712000	714000	the flag of Indonesia. Please examine.
714000	716000	(Laughter)
716000	719000	(Applause)
719000	721000	Not sure how this came to be, but it's not right.
721000	724000	In Monaco, "No, what are you talking about?
724000	726000	They are so different.
726000	728000	Look, ours is more red, it's longer.
728000	731000	They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"
731000	736000	(Laughter)
736000	738000	Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.
738000	741000	And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.
741000	744000	That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.
744000	746000	(Laughter)
746000	749000	Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.
749000	751000	And I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude,
751000	753000	could you touch your tooth? That's good."
753000	755000	Just a tip, if you're being photographed
755000	758000	for press pictures, don't touch your teeth.
758000	760000	(Laughter)
760000	762000	Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.
762000	764000	Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing
764000	767000	since before I was born.
767000	769000	I know that scares a lot of you,
769000	771000	but that was my purpose entirely.
771000	773000	There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,
773000	775000	because Fibonacci and Golden Section
775000	779000	relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.
779000	781000	If Fibonacci had been on Paxil,
781000	784000	(Laughter)
784000	786000	that would be the Fibonacci series.
786000	788000	"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."
788000	791000	"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills."
791000	793000	"Yes, Mama."
793000	798000	(Laughter)
798000	801000	Alright where is this going? That's a good question.
801000	804000	Here is the premise that I began 27 years ago.
804000	807000	If numbers can express
807000	809000	the laws of this incredible universe that we live,
809000	812000	I reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,
812000	814000	we could extrapolate from them
814000	817000	some basic structural element of this universe.
817000	819000	And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago
819000	821000	I started working on this.
821000	826000	And I tried to build a particle accelerator.
826000	827000	(Laughter)
827000	829000	And that didn't work out well.
829000	831000	So, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.
831000	834000	I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.
834000	837000	That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.
837000	839000	Moleeds are what I believe
839000	842000	the thing that will allow string theory to be proved.
842000	845000	They are the nodes on the string,
845000	847000	patterns and relationships, 27, 37.
847000	850000	That was the first chart I came up with.
850000	852000	You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,
852000	854000	the beauty of the symmetry.
854000	857000	The numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.
857000	859000	Symmetry, pairs.
859000	862000	Every top adds up to 37.
862000	864000	Bottom, all 74.
864000	867000	There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,
867000	869000	because you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."
869000	873000	(Laughter)
873000	877000	Circle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.
877000	878000	I knew those two were related.
878000	881000	Once again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.
881000	884000	So, I said if I'm going to put a circle,
884000	887000	see what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.
887000	889000	Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.
889000	891000	(Laughter)
891000	894000	You can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle
894000	896000	and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,
896000	898000	and it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out."
898000	901000	This is beyond anything anybody could just make up.
901000	903000	There is the Orange System.
903000	904000	(Laughter)
904000	908000	And you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.
908000	911000	And they recapitulate that shape,
911000	915000	even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.
915000	916000	(Laughter)
916000	918000	That's the Green System. It all folds in half
918000	920000	on the Green System, right between 18 and 19.
920000	923000	The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.
923000	931000	(Laughter)
931000	934000	Look at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.
934000	935000	(Laughter)
935000	938000	That just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.
938000	940000	Twenty-seven years of my life!
940000	941000	(Laughter)
941000	943000	And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?
943000	945000	Because this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.
945000	946000	(Laughter)
946000	949000	"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."
949000	951000	(Laughter)
951000	953000	In this last year I have found these subsequent systems
953000	957000	which allow for the mathematic possibilities
957000	959000	of the Calabi-Yau manifolds
959000	962000	in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.
962000	965000	Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.
965000	968000	It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.
968000	970000	I don't want hidden, I want to see it.
970000	972000	(Laughter)
972000	975000	I found other pairs all have symmetry,
975000	978000	even though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.
978000	981000	Unbelievable. This is like crazy.
981000	983000	Am I the only one that sees this?
983000	988000	(Laughter)
988000	990000	You know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.
990000	993000	You know, try making some charts like this at home.
993000	995000	You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.
995000	997000	These are maps, by the way.
997000	999000	Not stamps, but one day.
999000	1001000	(Laughter)
1001000	1004000	Okay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.
1004000	1008000	And look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.
1008000	1010000	I start looking at that, and look at them again.
1010000	1012000	They start looking like planets.
1012000	1014000	I go to JPL.
1014000	1017000	I look at the orbits of the planets.
1017000	1021000	I find 18 examples of it in our solar system.
1021000	1024000	I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history.
1024000	1025000	(Laughter)
1025000	1029000	Kepler was right.
1029000	1035000	(Laughter)
1035000	1037000	Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section.
1037000	1039000	Multiply them together, 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247.
1039000	1044000	Which is .005 different from the number of days in a year.
1044000	1046000	Hey, you can't make this up.
1046000	1048000	(Laughter)
1048000	1050000	Thank you very much.
1050000	1051000	(Applause)
1051000	1053000	Thank you.
1053000	1055000	(Applause)
1055000	1057000	Thank you.
1057000	1057000	(Applause)
