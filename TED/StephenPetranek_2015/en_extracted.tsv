1480	3400	Strap yourselves in,
3400	5400	we're going to Mars.
5400	7520	Not just a few astronauts --
7520	10680	thousands of people are going to colonize Mars.
10680	14640	And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon.
14640	17560	Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars,
17560	21760	and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.
21760	24160	That probably sounds preposterous,
24160	27760	so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen.
27760	31000	But first I want to discuss the obvious question:
31000	33640	Why the heck should we do this?
33640	34880	12 years ago,
34880	38720	I gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly.
38720	43520	We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy.
43520	47120	A single, large asteroid could take us out forever.
47120	50600	To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet.
50600	52840	Think what a tragedy it would be
52840	56720	if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.
56720	58760	And there's another reason we should go:
58760	61720	exploration is in our DNA.
61720	65200	Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa
65200	70040	and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet
70040	73560	by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons.
73560	75840	This stuff is inside us.
75840	78240	And they prospered doing that.
78240	82160	Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology
82160	85080	came because we explored.
85080	86560	Yes, we could do a lot of good
86560	90880	with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
90880	96120	And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet.
96120	102320	And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.
102320	103960	But think for a moment,
103960	108920	what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon.
108920	113400	He excited an entire generation to dream.
113400	116360	Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars.
116360	119120	Perhaps then we will look back at Earth
119120	122520	and see that that is one people instead of many
122520	125080	and perhaps then we will look back at Earth,
125080	127520	as we struggle to survive on Mars,
127520	131520	and realize how precious the home planet is.
131520	137040	So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake.
137040	138320	But first,
138320	142040	a few fascinating facts about where we're going.
142040	146440	This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth.
146440	148360	Mars is not our sister planet.
148360	151160	It's far less than half the size of the Earth,
151160	153200	and yet despite the fact that it's smaller,
153200	155920	the surface area of Mars that you can stand on
155920	159880	is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on,
159880	163000	because the Earth is mostly covered by water.
163000	165320	The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --
165320	167920	100 times thinner than on Earth --
167920	172760	and it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.
172760	174400	It's really cold there.
174400	177400	The average temperature is minus 81 degrees,
177400	181320	although there is quite a range of temperature.
181320	183920	A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth,
183920	186440	plus about 39 minutes.
186440	192000	Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.
192000	196680	And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day,
196680	199520	Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,
199520	200800	and it's the kind of place
200800	204120	where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.
204120	207800	Now, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,
207800	213360	but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.
213360	214880	Here's the problem.
214880	217080	Mars is a long way away,
217080	222560	a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon.
222560	226360	The Moon is 250,000 miles away
226360	230720	and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there.
230720	233880	Mars is 250 million miles away
233880	236160	and it will take us eight months to get there --
236160	238080	240 days.
238080	240680	And that's only if we launch on a very specific day,
240680	242440	at a very specific time,
242440	244440	once every two years,
244440	247640	when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so,
247640	252640	so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.
252640	258800	240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.
258800	262880	And meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy.
262880	265720	We and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese,
265720	267080	the Chinese and the Indians,
267080	269680	have actually sent 44 rockets there,
269680	273240	and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed.
273240	277760	Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.
277760	283080	And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway.
283080	285200	We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.
285200	287840	A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there.
287840	291320	It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans,
291320	294120	and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon.
294120	299160	But the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station,
299160	302280	and we decided to do something called the shuttle
302280	306680	instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon.
306680	308160	The biggest rocket we have now
308160	312200	is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.
312200	315240	So getting to Mars is not going to be easy
315240	319560	and that brings up a really interesting question ...
319560	325160	how soon will the first humans actually land here?
325160	329520	Now, some pundits think if we got there by 2050,
329520	331840	that'd be a pretty good achievement.
331840	338280	These days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.
338280	340600	Maybe they can.
340600	345720	I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.
345720	347000	But frankly,
347000	351760	I don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,
351760	353760	because we will already be there.
353760	358280	We're going to land on Mars in 2027.
358280	359520	And the reason is
359520	361600	this man is determined to make that happen.
361600	367920	His name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
367920	373000	Now, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025,
373000	375920	but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am --
375920	377440	and that's going a ways --
377440	380960	so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack.
380960	382400	Still ...
382400	383760	you've got to ask yourself,
383760	388760	can this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?
388760	393200	Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective.
393200	395360	Where was this 10 years ago?
395360	397640	That's the Tesla electric automobile.
397640	401320	In 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying,
401320	408280	we would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.
408280	410120	And where was that?
410120	413320	That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,
413320	417720	lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.
417720	418960	10 years ago,
418960	424600	SpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere.
424600	427160	So I think it's a pretty good bet
427160	430240	that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry
430240	431480	in less than 10 years
431480	437320	and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years
437320	440760	will get us to Mars by 2027.
440760	443760	Now, you need to know this:
443760	448040	governments and robots no longer control this game.
448040	450440	Private companies are leaping into space
450440	453800	and they will be happy to take you to Mars.
453800	457400	And that raises a really big question.
457400	460680	Can we actually live there?
460680	464880	Now, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040,
464880	467000	or we may get there a long time before NASA,
467000	472880	but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.
472880	474920	Let's look at the problem this way.
474920	476800	Here's what you need to live on Earth:
476800	480240	food, water, shelter and clothing.
480240	482760	And here's what you need to live on Mars:
482760	486160	all of the above, plus oxygen.
486160	490280	So let's look at the most important thing on this list first.
490280	493320	Water is the basis of all life as we know it,
493320	497920	and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live,
497920	503840	so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars.
503840	506360	And if you look at Mars, it looks really dry,
506360	509200	it looks like the entire planet is a desert.
509200	511240	But it turns out that it's not.
511240	516480	The soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water.
516480	521440	And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us --
521440	524000	and by the way, that's a real photograph --
524000	528160	that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them.
528160	531855	It's not a bad place to start a colony.
531855	536040	Now, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,
536040	539600	showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice --
539600	541880	that white stuff is ice.
541880	543160	In the second picture,
543160	545440	which is four days later than the first picture,
545440	548040	you can see that some of it is evaporating.
548040	549440	Orbiters also tell us
549440	552880	that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars
552880	554960	as well as glaciers.
554960	559240	In fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted,
559240	562960	most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water.
562960	565080	So there's plenty of water there,
565080	567640	but most of it's ice, most of it's underground,
567640	572040	it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.
572040	574800	This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington
574800	576840	back in 1998.
576840	579920	It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.
579920	584000	And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid.
584000	588400	So this device can extract all the water that humans will need
588400	592160	simply from the atmosphere on Mars.
592160	595160	Next we have to worry about what we will breathe.
595160	597080	Frankly, I was really shocked
597080	600280	to find out that NASA has this problem worked out.
600280	604120	This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht.
604120	606640	And he's developed this machine, Moxie.
606640	607880	I love this thing.
607880	610480	It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,
610480	614280	that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen.
614280	616280	And you have to remember that CO2 --
616280	620160	carbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --
620160	623920	CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.
623920	628280	Now, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020
628280	630520	is going to have one of these devices aboard,
630520	633240	and it will be able to produce enough oxygen
633240	635960	to keep one person alive indefinitely.
635960	638120	But the secret to this --
638120	639840	and that's just for testing --
639840	643160	the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go
643160	646840	to be scalable by a factor of 100.
646840	649080	Next, what will we eat?
649080	652040	Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,
652040	653920	but we're not going to be able to grow
653920	656080	more than 15 to 20 percent of our food there,
656080	659600	at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars
659600	664680	and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops.
664680	665960	In the meantime,
665960	668080	most of our food will arrive from Earth,
668080	670480	and it will be dried.
670480	673120	And then we need some shelter.
673120	676760	At first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings
676760	679040	as well as the landers themselves.
679040	682040	But this really only works during the daytime.
682040	687160	There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays.
687160	689360	So we really have to go underground.
689360	692080	Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,
692080	695080	by and large, is perfect for making bricks.
695080	697320	And NASA has figured this one out, too.
697320	700200	They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks,
700200	702000	shove them in a microwave oven,
702000	705280	and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls.
705280	711280	Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes,
711280	714040	of which there are plenty.
714040	716120	And finally there's clothing.
716120	719360	On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us,
719360	722680	which creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times,
722680	724847	and we're constantly pushing out against that.
724847	728720	On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure.
728720	730640	So Dava Newman,
730640	732120	a scientist at MIT,
732120	735200	has created this sleek space suit.
735200	736720	It will keep us together,
736720	740160	block radiation and keep us warm.
740160	742080	So let's think about this for a minute.
742080	745960	Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...
745960	747600	we can do this.
747600	749720	We really can.
749720	753800	But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.
753800	756640	So that leads to the next big --
756640	758240	really big step --
758240	760080	in living the good life on Mars.
760080	762600	And that's terraforming the planet:
762600	764480	making it more like Earth,
764480	768160	reengineering an entire planet.
768160	770040	That sounds like a lot of hubris,
770040	771280	but the truth is
771280	776200	that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.
776200	778400	First we've got to warm it up.
778400	783120	Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere.
783120	787480	The answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars,
787480	788760	both of which are covered
788760	791960	with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide --
791960	793440	dry ice.
793440	794800	If we heat it up,
794800	797400	it sublimes directly into the atmosphere
797400	800240	and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.
800240	801480	And as we know,
801480	805840	CO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas.
805840	811800	Now, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail
811800	813040	and focus it --
813040	814800	it essentially serves as a mirror --
814800	817200	and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first.
817200	821240	As the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it,
821240	823520	and it will go into the atmosphere.
823520	825040	It actually won't take long
825040	827320	for the temperature on Mars to start rising,
827320	830560	probably less than 20 years.
830560	831800	Right now,
831800	833800	on a perfect day at the equator,
833800	835920	in the middle of summer on Mars,
835920	838400	temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees,
838400	840840	but then they go down to minus 100 at night.
840840	842440	(Laughter)
842440	846800	What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect:
846800	850640	enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars --
850640	854000	especially the ice in the ground -- melt.
854000	856000	Then we get some real magic.
856000	859200	As the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better.
859200	861840	We get more protection from radiation,
861840	864960	more atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer,
864960	866680	so we get running water
866680	868920	and that makes crops possible.
868920	873920	Then more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
873920	878160	It will rain and it will snow on Mars.
878160	881440	And a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure
881440	884000	so that we can throw away those space suits.
884000	887400	We only need about five pounds of pressure to survive.
887400	894040	Eventually, Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia.
894040	896400	We'll still be left with the complicated problem
896400	898160	of making the atmosphere breathable,
898160	901800	and frankly that could take 1,000 years to accomplish.
901800	905960	But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable.
905960	910960	There is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish
910960	913750	and no telling what we can do with our own bodies.
913750	916280	In biology right now,
916280	921520	we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics,
921520	924080	what the genes in our own bodies are doing,
924080	926240	and certainly,
926240	928920	eventually, our own evolution.
928920	932560	We could end up with a species of human being on Earth
932560	938280	that is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars.
938280	940560	But what would you do there? How would you live?
940560	943560	It's going to be the same as it is on Earth.
943560	945840	Somebody's going to start a restaurant,
945840	948800	somebody's going to build an iron foundry.
948800	951080	Someone will make documentary movies of Mars
951080	954560	and sell them on Earth.
954560	957600	Some idiot will start a reality TV show.
957600	959680	(Laughter)
959680	961960	There will be software companies,
961960	965760	there will be hotels, there will be bars.
965760	967200	This much is certain:
967200	971440	it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes,
971440	974800	and I think it will be the most inspiring.
974800	978880	Ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars.
978880	984280	Children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there.
984280	987320	Remember when we landed humans on the Moon?
987320	990120	When that happened, people looked at each other and said,
990120	993760	"If we can do this, we can do anything."
993760	998920	What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars?
998920	1000320	Most importantly,
1000320	1003720	it will make us a spacefaring species.
1003720	1009200	And that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth.
1009200	1012320	We will never be the last of our kind.
1012320	1013560	Thank you.
1013560	1013560	(Applause)
