760	5240	How many companies have you interacted with today?
5240	6920	Well, you got up in the morning,
6920	8160	took a shower,
8160	9440	washed your hair,
9440	11000	used a hair dryer,
11000	12240	ate breakfast --
12240	14122	ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever --
14122	15360	had coffee --
15360	16760	tea.
16760	18760	You took public transport to come here,
18760	21520	or maybe used your private car.
21520	26160	You interacted with the company that you work for or that you own.
26160	28760	You interacted with your clients,
28760	30640	your customers,
30640	31920	and so on and so forth.
31920	35560	I'm pretty sure there are at least seven companies
35560	37960	you've interacted with today.
37960	40840	Let me tell you a stunning statistic.
40840	45240	One out of seven large, public corporations
45240	48400	commit fraud every year.
48400	51840	This is a US academic study that looks at US companies --
51840	55480	I have no reason to believe that it's different in Europe.
55480	59720	This is a study that looks at both detected and undetected fraud
59720	61480	using statistical methods.
61480	64120	This is not petty fraud.
64120	67000	These frauds cost the shareholders of these companies,
67000	68280	and therefore society,
68280	72960	on the order of 380 billion dollars per year.
72960	75200	We can all think of some examples, right?
75200	79800	The car industry's secrets aren't quite so secret anymore.
79800	83120	Fraud has become a feature,
83120	84360	not a bug,
84360	86320	of the financial services industry.
86320	88560	That's not me who's claiming that,
88560	91840	that's the president of the American Finance Association
91840	94800	who stated that in his presidential address.
94800	97560	That's a huge problem if you think about, especially,
97560	99280	an economy like Switzerland,
99280	104960	which relies so much on the trust put into its financial industry.
104960	106200	On the other hand,
106200	109760	there are six out of seven companies who actually remain honest
109760	114240	despite all temptations to start engaging in fraud.
114240	116560	There are whistle-blowers like Michael Woodford,
116560	118920	who blew the whistle on Olympus.
118920	121640	These whistle-blowers risk their careers,
121640	122880	their friendships,
122880	125040	to bring out the truth about their companies.
125040	127680	There are journalists like Anna Politkovskaya
127680	131560	who risk even their lives to report human rights violations.
131560	132800	She got killed --
132800	134040	every year,
134040	135720	around 100 journalists get killed
135720	140040	because of their conviction to bring out the truth.
140040	141320	So in my talk today,
141320	144840	I want to share with you some insights I've obtained and learned
144840	148160	in the last 10 years of conducting research in this.
148160	151680	I'm a researcher, a scientist working with economists,
151680	153040	financial economists,
153040	155120	ethicists, neuroscientists,
155120	156480	lawyers and others
156480	158600	trying to understand what makes humans tick,
158600	163400	and how can we address this issue of fraud in corporations
163400	167280	and therefore contribute to the improvement of the world.
167280	170840	I want to start by sharing with you two very distinct visions
170840	172680	of how people behave.
172680	175200	First, meet Adam Smith,
175200	178280	founding father of modern economics.
178280	182600	His basic idea was that if everybody behaves in their own self-interests,
182600	186080	that's good for everybody in the end.
186080	189160	Self-interest isn't a narrowly defined concept
189160	191120	just for your immediate utility.
191120	193080	It has a long-run implication.
193080	195080	Let's think about that.
195080	197120	Think about this dog here.
197120	199440	That might be us.
199440	200720	There's this temptation --
200720	203120	I apologize to all vegetarians, but --
203120	204160	(Laughter)
204160	205880	Dogs do like the bratwurst.
205880	208280	(Laughter)
208280	211400	Now, the straight-up, self-interested move here
211400	213000	is to go for that.
213000	215960	So my friend Adam here might jump up,
215960	220000	get the sausage and thereby ruin all this beautiful tableware.
220000	221840	But that's not what Adam Smith meant.
221840	224520	He didn't mean disregard all consequences --
224520	225760	to the contrary.
225760	227040	He would have thought,
227040	229080	well, there may be negative consequences,
229080	230320	for example,
230320	233440	the owner might be angry with the dog
233440	237840	and the dog, anticipating that, might not behave in this way.
237840	239120	That might be us,
239120	242200	weighing the benefits and costs of our actions.
242200	243960	How does that play out?
243960	245960	Well, many of you, I'm sure,
245960	247520	have in your companies,
247520	249360	especially if it's a large company,
249360	251040	a code of conduct.
251040	254480	And then if you behave according to that code of conduct,
254480	257680	that improves your chances of getting a bonus payment.
257680	259839	And on the other hand, if you disregard it,
259839	262600	then there are higher chances of not getting your bonus
262600	264160	or its being diminished.
264160	265440	In other words,
265440	267280	this is a very economic motivation
267280	270080	of trying to get people to be more honest,
270080	274240	or more aligned with the corporation's principles.
274240	279520	Similarly, reputation is a very powerful economic force, right?
279520	281080	We try to build a reputation,
281080	282520	maybe for being honest,
282520	285960	because then people trust us more in the future.
285960	287200	Right?
287200	289320	Adam Smith talked about the baker
289320	293120	who's not producing good bread out of his benevolence
293120	296160	for those people who consume the bread,
296160	300160	but because he wants to sell more future bread.
300160	302400	In my research, we find, for example,
302400	303800	at the University of Zurich,
303800	308720	that Swiss banks who get caught up in media,
308720	310520	and in the context, for example,
310520	312080	of tax evasion, of tax fraud,
312080	313840	have bad media coverage.
313840	316600	They lose net new money in the future
316600	318240	and therefore make lower profits.
318240	322200	That's a very powerful reputational force.
322200	325120	Benefits and costs.
325120	327720	Here's another viewpoint of the world.
327720	329280	Meet Immanuel Kant,
329280	332920	18th-century German philosopher superstar.
332920	334560	He developed this notion
334560	337720	that independent of the consequences,
337720	340720	some actions are just right
340720	342440	and some are just wrong.
342440	345680	It's just wrong to lie, for example.
345680	348840	So, meet my friend Immanuel here.
348840	351680	He knows that the sausage is very tasty,
351680	354160	but he's going to turn away because he's a good dog.
354160	356880	He knows it's wrong to jump up
356880	360520	and risk ruining all this beautiful tableware.
360520	362960	If you believe that people are motivated like that,
362960	365160	then all the stuff about incentives,
365160	368960	all the stuff about code of conduct and bonus systems and so on,
368960	371160	doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
371160	375360	People are motivated by different values perhaps.
375360	378760	So, what are people actually motivated by?
378760	380960	These two gentlemen here have perfect hairdos,
380960	385840	but they give us very different views of the world.
385840	387120	What do we do with this?
387120	388800	Well, I'm an economist
388800	393000	and we conduct so-called experiments to address this issue.
393000	396320	We strip away facts which are confusing in reality.
396320	399080	Reality is so rich, there is so much going on,
399080	403520	it's almost impossible to know what drives people's behavior really.
403520	406680	So let's do a little experiment together.
406680	410400	Imagine the following situation.
410400	412840	You're in a room alone,
412840	414400	not like here.
414400	418560	There's a five-franc coin like the one I'm holding up right now
418560	420160	in front of you.
420160	421760	Here are your instructions:
421760	425800	toss the coin four times,
425800	428240	and then on a computer terminal in front of you,
428240	431920	enter the number of times tails came up.
431920	433720	This is the situation.
433720	434960	Here's the rub.
434960	438360	For every time that you announce that you had a tails throw,
438360	439880	you get paid five francs.
439880	442440	So if you say I had two tails throws,
442440	444680	you get paid 10 francs.
444680	447640	If you say you had zero, you get paid zero francs.
447640	450120	If you say, "I had four tails throws,"
450120	452160	then you get paid 20 francs.
452160	453440	It's anonymous,
453440	455360	nobody's watching what you're doing,
455360	457720	and you get paid that money anonymously.
457720	459760	I've got two questions for you.
459760	461400	(Laughter)
461400	464000	You know what's coming now, right?
464000	468240	First, how would you behave in that situation?
468240	471200	The second, look to your left and look to your right --
471200	472240	(Laughter)
472240	474640	and think about how the person sitting next to you
474640	476320	might behave in that situation.
476320	478480	We did this experiment for real.
478480	481200	We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition
481200	483680	that took place here in Zurich recently,
483680	486560	not with students in the lab at the university
486560	488360	but with the real population,
488360	490080	like you guys.
490080	492240	First, a quick reminder of stats.
492240	495840	If I throw the coin four times and it's a fair coin,
495840	499960	then the probability that it comes up four times tails
499960	503080	is 6.25 percent.
503080	504760	And I hope you can intuitively see
504760	508160	that the probability that all four of them are tails is much lower
508160	510760	than if two of them are tails, right?
510760	514039	Here are the specific numbers.
514039	515559	Here's what happened.
515559	518799	People did this experiment for real.
518799	522159	Around 30 to 35 percent of people said,
522159	525640	"Well, I had four tails throws."
525640	527480	That's extremely unlikely.
527480	529440	(Laughter)
529440	532600	But the really amazing thing here,
532600	533920	perhaps to an economist,
533920	540480	is there are around 65 percent of people who did not say I had four tails throws,
540480	542680	even though in that situation,
542680	544800	nobody's watching you,
544800	546760	the only consequence that's in place
546760	550120	is you get more money if you say four than less.
550120	554040	You leave 20 francs on the table by announcing zero.
554040	556640	I don't know whether the other people all were honest
556640	560120	or whether they also said a little bit higher or lower than what they did
560120	561360	because it's anonymous.
561360	563040	We only observed the distribution.
563040	565720	But what I can tell you -- and here's another coin toss.
565720	567240	There you go, it's tails.
567240	568760	(Laughter)
568760	570240	Don't check, OK?
570240	573080	(Laughter)
573080	574400	What I can tell you
574400	580840	is that not everybody behaved like Adam Smith would have predicted.
580840	582440	So what does that leave us with?
582440	586960	Well, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values
586960	589440	and in our research, we look at this.
589440	594760	We look at the idea that people have so-called protected values.
594760	597600	A protected value isn't just any value.
597600	603440	A protected value is a value where you're willing to pay a price
603440	604720	to uphold that value.
604720	610200	You're willing to pay a price to withstand the temptation to give in.
610200	612880	And the consequence is you feel better
612880	617200	if you earn money in a way that's consistent with your values.
617200	622600	Let me show you this again in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.
622600	626680	If we succeed in getting the sausage without violating our values,
626680	628680	then the sausage tastes better.
628680	630720	That's what our research shows.
630720	632000	If, on the other hand,
632000	633280	we do so --
633280	634720	if we get the sausage
634720	638200	and in doing so we actually violate values,
638200	641200	we value the sausage less.
641200	643680	Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.
643680	646160	We can measure these protected values,
646160	647400	for example,
647400	650360	by a survey measure.
650360	656360	Simple, nine-item survey that's quite predictive in these experiments.
656360	658720	If you think about the average of the population
658720	660840	and then there's a distribution around it --
660840	663480	people are different, we all are different.
663480	666480	People who have a set of protected values
666480	670680	that's one standard deviation above the average,
670680	675760	they discount money they receive by lying by about 25 percent.
675760	679400	That means a dollar received when lying
679400	681560	is worth to them only 75 cents
681560	685280	without any incentives you put in place for them to behave honestly.
685280	687040	It's their intrinsic motivation.
687040	688920	By the way, I'm not a moral authority.
688920	692440	I'm not saying I have all these beautiful values, right?
692440	694400	But I'm interested in how people behave
694400	697800	and how we can leverage that richness in human nature
697800	702400	to actually improve the workings of our organizations.
702400	705600	So there are two very, very different visions here.
705600	706960	On the one hand,
706960	710000	you can appeal to benefits and costs
710000	712680	and try to get people to behave according to them.
712680	714320	On the other hand,
714320	718360	you can select people who have the values
718360	720600	and the desirable characteristics, of course --
720600	724200	competencies that go in line with your organization.
724200	728440	I do not yet know where these protected values really come from.
728440	731840	Is it nurture or is it nature?
731840	733240	What I can tell you
733240	738360	is that the distribution looks pretty similar for men and women.
738360	742160	It looks pretty similar for those who had studied economics
742160	746000	or those who had studied psychology.
746000	749400	It looks even pretty similar around different age categories
749400	750640	among adults.
750640	753320	But I don't know yet how this develops over a lifetime.
753320	757640	That will be the subject of future research.
757640	759320	The idea I want to leave you with
759320	762120	is it's all right to appeal to incentives.
762120	763360	I'm an economist;
763360	767400	I certainly believe in the fact that incentives work.
767400	771440	But do think about selecting the right people
771440	774960	rather than having people and then putting incentives in place.
774960	777240	Selecting the right people with the right values
777240	781200	may go a long way to saving a lot of trouble
781200	782600	and a lot of money
782600	784360	in your organizations.
784360	785640	In other words,
785640	790040	it will pay off to put people first.
790040	791280	Thank you.
791280	791280	(Applause)
