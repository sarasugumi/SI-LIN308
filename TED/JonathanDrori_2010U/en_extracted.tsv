0	3000	Thank you. I have two missions here today.
3000	7000	The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,
7000	10000	and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.
10000	12000	And, secondly, to convince you
12000	15000	that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.
15000	17000	(Laughter)
17000	21000	Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.
21000	23000	It carries male sex cells
23000	25000	from one flower to another.
25000	27000	This gives us genetic diversity,
27000	29000	or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.
29000	33000	And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.
33000	37000	That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.
37000	39000	Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.
39000	44000	Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,
44000	46000	so, it's quite prolific stuff.
46000	48000	And it isn't just bright flowers
48000	52000	that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.
52000	57000	And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.
57000	61000	Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.
61000	64000	The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,
64000	66000	but that's for the pollen tube
66000	68000	to come out later on. A very tiny tube.
68000	70000	So, that's 20 micrometers across,
70000	72000	that pollen grain there.
72000	74000	That's about a 50th of a millimeter.
74000	77000	But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.
77000	80000	This is Morina. This is a plant --
80000	82000	which I've always thought to be rather tedious --
82000	84000	named after Morin,
84000	86000	who was an enterprising French gardener,
86000	88000	who issued the first seed catalog
88000	90000	in 1621.
90000	94000	But anyway, take a look at its pollen.
94000	96000	This is amazing, I think.
96000	98000	That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,
98000	101000	and when the pollen finds its special female spot
101000	103000	in another Morina flower,
103000	106000	just on the right species, what happens?
106000	109000	Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.
109000	112000	If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,
112000	114000	they have rampant, promiscuous
114000	116000	and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.
116000	120000	(Laughter) A lot.
120000	123000	My story is actually not about plant propagation,
123000	125000	but about pollen itself.
125000	128000	"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.
128000	130000	First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.
130000	132000	It's also very biologically active,
132000	134000	as anyone with hay fever will understand.
134000	137000	Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --
137000	140000	like trees and grasses and so on --
140000	142000	tend to cause the most hay fever.
142000	144000	And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out
144000	146000	masses and masses of pollen to have any chance
146000	150000	of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.
150000	152000	Here are some examples --
152000	155000	they're very smooth if you look at them --
155000	158000	of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.
158000	160000	Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.
160000	163000	So, trees: very boring flowers,
163000	166000	not really trying to attract insects.
166000	168000	Cool pollen, though.
168000	170000	This one I particularly like.
170000	173000	This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks
173000	175000	to make the pollen carry even further.
175000	179000	Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.
179000	182000	Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.
182000	185000	This is a bee's leg
185000	189000	with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.
189000	191000	And this is the outrageous and beautiful
191000	193000	flower of the mangrove palm.
193000	196000	Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.
196000	198000	The pollen has little barbs on it,
198000	200000	if we look.
200000	202000	Now, those little barbs
202000	205000	obviously stick to the insects well,
205000	207000	but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,
207000	209000	and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line
209000	212000	across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.
212000	215000	That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.
215000	217000	And I'm rather proud to say
217000	220000	that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago
220000	223000	London was full of mangroves.
223000	225000	Isn't that cool?
225000	228000	(Laughter)
228000	231000	Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.
231000	234000	You can tell that from the little barbs on there.
234000	237000	All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,
237000	239000	actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.
239000	241000	No coincidence that these were taken
241000	243000	by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,
243000	246000	and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye
246000	250000	like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.
250000	252000	(Laughter)
252000	254000	Now, all this diversity
254000	256000	means that you can look at a pollen grain
256000	259000	and tell what species it came from,
259000	261000	and that's actually quite handy if you
261000	264000	maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.
264000	266000	So, different species of plants
266000	268000	grow in different places,
268000	272000	and some pollen carries further than others.
272000	275000	So, if you have a pollen sample,
275000	277000	then in principle, you should be able to tell
277000	279000	where that sample came from.
279000	284000	And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.
284000	288000	Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.
288000	290000	So, not only does each type of pollen look different,
290000	294000	but each habitat has a different combination of plants.
294000	296000	A different pollen signature, if you like,
296000	301000	or a different pollen fingerprint.
301000	303000	By looking at the proportions and combinations
303000	306000	of different kinds of pollen in a sample,
306000	309000	you can tell very precisely where it came from.
309000	312000	This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,
312000	315000	similar to the one that I'm wearing now.
315000	317000	Now, much of the pollen will still be there
317000	319000	after repeated washings.
319000	322000	Where has it been?
322000	324000	Four very different habitats might look similar,
324000	327000	but they've got very different pollen signatures.
327000	329000	Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken
329000	331000	in different countries.
331000	333000	But pollen forensics can be very subtle.
333000	335000	It's being used now to track
335000	337000	where counterfeit drugs have been made,
337000	340000	where banknotes have come from,
340000	342000	to look at the provenance of antiques
342000	344000	and see that they really did come from the place
344000	347000	the seller said they did.
347000	349000	And murder suspects have been tracked
349000	351000	using their clothing,
351000	354000	certainly in the U.K., to within an area
354000	356000	that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs
356000	358000	to find the murder victim.
358000	360000	So, you can tell from a piece of clothing
360000	364000	to within about a kilometer or so,
364000	366000	where that piece of clothing has been recently
366000	369000	and then send in dogs.
369000	372000	And finally, in a rather grizzly way,
372000	374000	the Bosnia war crimes;
374000	377000	some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial
377000	379000	because of the evidence from pollen,
379000	381000	which showed that bodies had been buried,
381000	386000	exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.
386000	388000	I hope I've opened your eyes,
388000	390000	if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)
390000	392000	to some of pollen's secrets.
392000	394000	This is a horse chestnut.
394000	396000	There is an invisible beauty all around us,
396000	398000	each grain with a story to tell ...
398000	400000	each of us, in fact, with a story to tell
400000	403000	from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.
403000	405000	Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,
405000	407000	and thank you to palynologists everywhere.
407000	407000	(Applause)
