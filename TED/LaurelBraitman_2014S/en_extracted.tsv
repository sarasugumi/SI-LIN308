1089	5153	Oliver was an extremely dashing,
5153	9974	handsome, charming and largely unstable male
9974	13159	that I completely lost my heart to.
13159	16080	(Laughter)
16080	17746	He was a Bernese mountain dog,
17746	20929	and my ex-husband and I adopted him,
20929	22618	and about six months in,
22618	25182	we realized that he was a mess.
25182	27962	He had such paralyzing separation anxiety
27962	29498	that we couldn't leave him alone.
29498	32626	Once, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.
32626	37047	He ate fabric. He ate things, recyclables.
37047	38952	He hunted flies that didn't exist.
38952	40681	He suffered from hallucinations.
40681	43985	He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder
43985	47331	and that's really just the tip of the iceberg.
47331	51432	But like with humans,
51432	54543	sometimes it's six months in
54543	56580	before you realize that
56580	59527	the person that you love has some issues.
59527	60938	(Laughter)
60938	64872	And most of us do not take the person we're dating
64872	67008	back to the bar where we met them
67008	71344	or give them back to the friend that introduced us,
71344	74098	or sign them back up on Match.com.
74098	76928	(Laughter)
76928	78727	We love them anyway,
78727	80723	and we stick to it,
80723	84955	and that is what I did with my dog.
84955	88757	And I was a — I'd studied biology.
88757	91377	I have a Ph.D. in history of science
91377	92882	from MIT,
92882	94580	and had you asked me 10 years ago
94580	96989	if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally,
96989	98825	had emotions, I would have said yes,
98825	100289	but I'm not sure that I would have told you
100289	102587	that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder,
102587	106678	a Prozac prescription and a therapist.
106678	110624	But then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can,
110624	113250	and actually trying to help my own dog
113250	115864	overcome his panic and his anxiety,
115864	118227	it just changed my life.
118227	120764	It cracked open my world.
120764	123131	And I spent the last seven years, actually,
123131	125730	looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals.
125730	127075	Can they be mentally ill like people,
127075	130080	and if so, what does it mean about us?
130080	132879	And what I discovered is that I do believe
132879	134819	they can suffer from mental illness,
134819	139295	and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them
139295	141377	often helps us be better friends to them
141377	145431	and also can help us better understand ourselves.
145431	148877	So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute.
148877	151558	Many of us think that we can't know
151558	154021	what another animal is thinking,
154021	155299	and that is true,
155299	157891	but any of you in relationships —
157891	159747	at least this is my case —
159747	161547	just because you ask someone that you're with
161547	163741	or your parent or your child how they feel
163741	165551	doesn't mean that they can tell you.
165551	167869	They may not have words to explain
167869	168932	what it is that they're feeling,
168932	170775	and they may not know.
170775	172640	It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon
172640	174386	that we feel that we have to talk to someone
174386	176790	to understand their emotional distress.
176790	179217	Before the early 20th century,
179217	181737	physicians often diagnosed emotional distress
181737	185235	in their patients just by observation.
185235	186918	It also turns out that thinking about
186918	188513	mental illness in other animals
188513	190706	isn't actually that much of a stretch.
190706	192619	Most mental disorders in the United States
192619	195339	are fear and anxiety disorders,
195339	197308	and when you think about it, fear and anxiety
197308	201500	are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions.
201500	204600	Usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous,
204600	205897	and once we feel them,
205897	207526	we then are motivated to move away
207526	209357	from whatever is dangerous.
209357	214326	The problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it.
214326	217536	Mood disorders, too, may actually just be
217536	221042	the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal,
221042	224207	and obsessive compulsive disorders also
224207	227616	are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing
227616	230396	which is keeping yourself clean and groomed.
230396	232544	This tips into the territory of mental illness
232544	233690	when you do things like
233690	236293	compulsively over-wash your hands or paws,
236293	238359	or you develop a ritual that's so extreme
238359	240451	that you can't sit down to a bowl of food
240451	243443	unless you engage in that ritual.
243443	247774	So for humans, we have the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,"
247774	249901	which is basically an atlas
249901	252634	of the currently agreed-upon mental disorders.
252634	255885	In other animals, we have YouTube.
255885	257491	(Laughter)
257491	260138	This is just one search I did for "OCD dog"
260138	261926	but I encourage all of you
261926	264877	to look at "OCD cat."
264877	268271	You will be shocked by what you see.
268271	272770	I'm going to show you just a couple examples.
272770	275492	This is an example of shadow-chasing.
275492	278568	I know, and it's funny and in some ways it's cute.
278568	282063	The issue, though, is that dogs can develop compulsions like this
282063	284965	that they then engage in all day.
284965	286237	So they won't go for a walk,
286237	287891	they won't hang out with their friends,
287891	289477	they won't eat.
289477	291010	They'll develop fixations
291010	294127	like chasing their tails compulsively.
294127	297528	Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo.
297528	300740	He looks like he's on a stakeout
300740	304054	but he does this for many, many, many hours a day.
304054	307558	He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw
307558	309092	at the screen.
309092	311569	This is another example of what's considered
311569	313353	a stereotypic behavior.
313353	316060	This is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting.
316060	317825	And if you just sort of happened upon this scene,
317825	318776	you might think that Ting Ting
318776	320490	is just playing with a stick,
320490	322536	but Ting Ting does this all day,
322536	324132	and if you pay close attention
324132	327803	and if I showed you guys the full half-hour of this clip,
327803	329829	you'd see that he does the exact same thing
329829	331978	in the exact same order, and he spins the stick
331978	334328	in the exact same way every time.
334328	336820	Other super common behaviors that you may see,
336820	338644	particularly in captive animals,
338644	343204	are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies,
343204	344880	and actually, humans do this too,
344880	346624	and in us, we'll sway,
346624	348211	we'll move from side to side.
348211	350482	Many of us do this, and sometimes
350482	352028	it's an effort to soothe ourselves,
352028	354678	and I think in other animals that is often the case too.
354678	356364	But it's not just stereotypic behaviors
356364	358130	that other animals engage in.
358130	360258	This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives
360258	361919	at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.
361919	364127	She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist,
364127	365849	and she's been treated for a mood disorder
365849	367432	among other things.
367432	370427	Many animals develop mood disorders.
370427	371855	Lots of creatures —
371855	373390	this horse is just one example —
373390	375072	develop self-destructive behaviors.
375072	376357	They'll gnaw on things
376357	378503	or do other things that may also soothe them,
378503	380201	even if they're self-destructive,
380201	381508	which could be considered similar
381508	385249	to the ways that some humans cut themselves.
385249	386562	Plucking.
386562	390319	Turns out, if you have fur or feathers or skin,
390319	392294	you can pluck yourself compulsively,
392294	394616	and some parrots actually have been studied
394616	397714	to better understand trichotillomania, or compulsive plucking in humans,
397714	399161	something that affects
399161	401441	20 million Americans right now.
401441	403509	Lab rats pluck themselves too.
403509	405742	In them, it's called barbering.
405742	408819	Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan
408819	411800	are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD,
411800	414512	and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life
414512	415797	when they come back from deployments.
415797	418403	They can be too scared to approach men with beards
418403	421116	or to hop into cars.
421116	423882	I want to be careful and be clear, though.
423882	426559	I do not think that canine PTSD
426559	429360	is the same as human PTSD.
429360	431835	But I also do not think that my PTSD
431835	432930	is like your PTSD,
432930	436632	or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours.
436632	438337	We are all different.
438337	441172	We also all have very different susceptibilities.
441172	444913	So two dogs, raised in the same household,
444913	447260	exposed to the very same things,
447260	451159	one may develop, say, a debilitating fear of motorcycles,
451159	453907	or a phobia of the beep of the microwave,
453907	455762	and another one is going to be just fine.
455762	458595	So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently:
458595	460538	Is this just an instance of humans
460538	462167	driving other animals crazy?
462167	466090	Or, is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse?
466090	467619	And it turns out we're actually
467619	471174	so much more complicated than that.
471174	474161	So one great thing that has happened to me
474161	477410	is recently I published a book on this,
477410	481355	and every day now that I open my email
481355	482809	or when I go to a reading
482809	484921	or even when I go to a cocktail party,
484921	486822	people tell me their stories
486822	488576	of the animals that they have met.
488576	491020	And recently, I did a reading in California,
491020	493450	and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said,
493450	497126	"Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."
497126	500490	And I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it."
500490	503909	So, Ping is her cat. She was a rescue,
503909	506631	and she used to live with an elderly man,
506631	508902	and one day the man was vacuuming
508902	511727	and he suffered a heart attack, and he died.
511727	514661	A week later, Ping was discovered in the apartment
514661	516655	alongside the body of her owner,
516655	520042	and the vacuum had been running the entire time.
520042	525350	For many months, up to I think two years after that incident,
525350	527960	she was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning.
527960	529750	She was quite literally a scaredy cat.
529750	532190	She would hide in the closet.
532190	533992	She was un-self-confident and shaky,
533992	536330	but with the loving support of her family,
536330	538726	a lot of a time, and their patience,
538726	539980	now, three years later,
539980	543225	she's actually a happy, confident cat.
543225	546180	Another story of trauma and recovery that I came across
546180	547676	was actually a few years ago.
547676	549916	I was in Thailand to do some research.
549916	553010	I met a monkey named Boonlua,
553010	555282	and when Boonlua was a baby,
555282	557296	he was attacked by a pack of dogs,
557296	562140	and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm,
562140	565283	and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery,
565283	566834	where the monks took him in.
566834	569445	They called in a veterinarian, who treated his wounds.
569445	571660	Eventually, Boonlua wound up
571660	573453	at an elephant facility,
573453	576422	and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing,
576422	577785	and they figured out what he liked,
577785	579804	which, it turned out, was mint Mentos
579804	583281	and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs.
583281	586453	But they worried, because he was social, that he was lonely,
586453	588220	and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey,
588220	589423	because they thought with just one arm,
589423	592218	he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play.
592218	594704	And so they gave him a rabbit,
594704	597517	and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey.
597517	599499	He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit.
599499	601779	They groomed each other, they become close friends,
601779	604482	and then the rabbit had bunnies,
604482	607339	and Boonlua was even happier than he was before,
607339	609589	and it had in a way given him
609589	611434	a reason to wake up in the morning,
611434	613188	and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up
613188	615191	that he decided not to sleep.
615191	618810	He became extremely protective of these bunnies,
618810	620058	and he stopped sleeping,
620058	621499	and he would sort of nod off
621499	623390	while trying to take care of them.
623390	625833	In fact, he was so protective and so affectionate
625833	627588	with these babies that the sanctuary
627588	629950	eventually had to take them away from him
629950	631885	because he was so protective, he was worried
631885	633764	that their mother might hurt them.
633764	635608	So after they were taken away, the sanctuary staff
635608	637217	worried that he would fall into a depression,
637217	638449	and so to avoid that,
638449	641447	they gave him another rabbit friend.
641447	644804	(Laughter)
644804	647509	My official opinion is that he does not look depressed.
647509	649459	(Laughter)
649459	653821	So one thing that I would really like people to feel
653821	656900	is that you really should feel empowered
656900	659373	to make some assumptions
659373	661196	about the creatures that you know well.
661196	662996	So when it comes to your dog
662996	665314	or your cat or maybe your one-armed monkey
665314	666742	that you happen to know,
666742	670537	if you think that they are traumatized or depressed,
670537	672663	you're probably right.
672663	675471	This is extremely anthropomorphic,
675471	678464	or the assignation of human characteristics
678464	682116	onto non-human animals or things.
682116	684257	I don't think, though, that that's a problem.
684257	686349	I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize.
686349	689251	It's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head
689251	691355	and put it in a jar and then use it
691355	693560	to think about another animal thinking.
693560	696158	We will always be one animal wondering
696158	698678	about the emotional experience of another animal.
698678	701671	So then the choice becomes, how do you anthropomorphize well?
701671	703931	Or do you anthropomorphize poorly?
703931	706215	And anthropomorphizing poorly
706215	708380	is all too common.
708380	710012	(Laughter)
710012	712616	It may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding,
712616	715272	or getting too close to exotic wildlife because
715272	717228	you believe that you had a spiritual connection.
717228	719206	There's all manner of things.
719206	723112	Anthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based
723112	725830	on accepting our animal similarities with other species
725830	728637	and using them to make assumptions
728637	732276	that are informed about other animals' minds and experiences,
732276	734822	and there's actually an entire industry
734822	737792	that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well,
737792	740953	and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry.
740953	745473	One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug,
745473	748128	from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications
748128	749950	to the antipsychotics.
749950	751784	It turns out that we owe this
751784	754157	entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal
754157	755889	to other animals.
755889	758399	These drugs were tested in non-human animals first,
758399	762335	and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects.
762335	765519	The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine
765519	769265	first relaxed rats before it relaxed people.
769265	771426	The antianxiety medication Librium
771426	775249	was given to cats selected for their meanness in the 1950s
775249	777640	and made them into peaceable felines.
777640	782200	And even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits.
782200	785104	Today, however, we are not just giving these drugs
785104	787455	to other animals as test subjects,
787455	789946	but they're giving them these drugs as patients,
789946	794429	both in ethical and much less ethical ways.
794429	798299	SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications
798299	800943	when their calves are taken away.
800943	803226	Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics
803226	805292	and antianxiety medications.
805292	808165	But dogs like my own Oliver
808165	811404	are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications
811404	813140	to keep them from jumping out of buildings
813140	815203	or jumping into traffic.
815203	818402	Just recently, actually, a study came out in "Science"
818402	820231	that showed that even crawdads
820231	822455	responded to antianxiety medication.
822455	824730	It made them braver, less skittish,
824730	829780	and more likely to explore their environment.
829780	832138	It's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs,
832138	835602	but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry
835602	837390	is immense and growing,
837390	840113	from seven billion dollars in 2011
840113	845692	to a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015.
845692	849539	Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely.
849539	853774	Others, like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee
853774	855360	at the zoo there was on them
855360	857511	until he started to save his Paxil prescription
857511	859907	and then distribute it among the other bonobos.
859907	864916	(Laughter) (Applause)
864916	867805	More than psychopharmaceuticals, though,
867805	870320	there are many, many, many other
870320	872968	therapeutic interventions that help other creatures.
872968	875330	And here is a place where I think actually
875330	877772	that veterinary medicine can teach something
877772	879458	to human medicine,
879458	881348	which is, if you take your dog, who is, say,
881348	883148	compulsively chasing his tail,
883148	884926	into the veterinary behaviorist,
884926	887730	their first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad;
887730	890686	it's to ask you about your dog's life.
890686	893622	They want to know how often your dog gets outside.
893622	896276	They want to know how much exercise your dog is getting.
896276	897761	They want to know how much social time
897761	900180	with other dogs and other humans.
900180	902390	They want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies,
902390	904905	largely behavior therapies,
904905	907165	you've tried with that animal.
907165	909562	Those are the things that often tend to help the most,
909562	912891	especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals.
912891	915344	The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most,
915344	917301	particularly with social animals,
917301	920439	is time with other social animals.
920439	924347	In many ways, I feel like I became a service animal
924347	926851	to my own dog,
926851	930878	and I have seen parrots do it for people
930878	932588	and people do it for parrots
932588	934126	and dogs do it for elephants
934126	937304	and elephants do it for other elephants.
937304	938637	I don't know about you;
938637	941217	I get a lot of Internet forwards
941217	943433	of unlikely animal friendships.
943433	946720	I also think it's a huge part of Facebook,
946720	949597	the monkey that adopts the cat
949597	954233	or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn,
954233	957237	or the cow that makes friends with the pig,
957237	961173	and had you asked me eight, nine years ago, about these,
961173	963663	I would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental
963663	966786	and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way
966786	969565	and maybe even staged, and what I can tell you now
969565	972517	is that there is actually something to this.
972517	976112	This is legit. In fact, some interesting studies
976112	978038	have pointed to oxytocin levels,
978038	980634	which are a kind of bonding hormone
980634	983040	that we release when we're having sex or nursing
983040	985629	or around someone that we care for extremely,
985629	988121	oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs
988121	989515	who care about each other
989515	991175	or who enjoy each other's company,
991175	993484	and beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin
993484	995620	raised even in other pairs of animals,
995620	999225	so, say, in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other,
999225	1003684	their levels spiked afterwards.
1003684	1006451	I have a friend who really showed me that
1006451	1008875	mental health is in fact a two-way street.
1008875	1012874	His name is Lonnie Hodge, and he's a veteran of Vietnam.
1012874	1015496	When he returned, he started working
1015496	1018139	with survivors of genocide and a lot of people
1018139	1019667	who had gone through war trauma.
1019667	1022151	And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights,
1022151	1024050	because in Vietnam, he had been
1024050	1026295	rappelling backwards out of helicopters
1026295	1027730	over the skids,
1027730	1030799	and he was givena service dog named Gander, a labradoodle,
1030799	1034250	to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights.
1034250	1036910	This is them actually on the first day that they met,
1036910	1039502	which is amazing, and since then,
1039502	1041267	they've spent a lot of time together
1041267	1045517	visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues.
1045517	1048579	But what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship
1048579	1050357	is about a few months in,
1050357	1053684	Gander actually developed a fear of heights,
1053684	1057981	probably because he was watching Lonnie so closely.
1057981	1061450	What's pretty great about this, though, is that he's still a fantastic service dog,
1061450	1063985	because now, when they're both at a great height,
1063985	1067343	Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being
1067343	1073317	that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself.
1073317	1076598	Since I've spent so much time with these stories,
1076598	1078002	digging into archives,
1078002	1080456	I literally spent years doing this research,
1080456	1082756	and it's changed me.
1082756	1086692	I no longer look at animals at the species level.
1086692	1088920	I look at them as individuals,
1088920	1090492	and I think about them as creatures
1090492	1093251	with their own individual weather systems
1093251	1094963	guiding their behavior and informing
1094963	1097272	how they respond to the world.
1097272	1100160	And I really believe that this has made me
1100160	1102524	a more curious and a more empathetic person,
1102524	1105967	both to the animals that share my bed
1105967	1108093	and occasionally wind up on my plate,
1108093	1110943	but also to the people that I know
1110943	1113894	who are suffering from anxiety
1113894	1116521	and from phobias and all manner of other things,
1116521	1118496	and I really do believe that
1118496	1120744	even though you can't know exactly
1120744	1124131	what's going on in the mind of a pig
1124131	1126248	or your pug or your partner,
1126248	1130055	that that shouldn't stop you from empathizing with them.
1130055	1132544	The best thing that we could do for our loved ones
1132544	1136840	is, perhaps, to anthropomorphize them.
1136840	1140341	Charles Darwin's father once told him
1140341	1145560	that everybody could lose their mind at some point.
1145560	1148391	Thankfully, we can often find them again,
1148391	1150562	but only with each other's help.
1150562	1152618	Thank you.
1152618	1152618	(Applause)
