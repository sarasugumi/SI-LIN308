821	4937	These are some photos of me volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage
4937	6840	in 2006.
6840	8767	When these photos were taken,
8767	11093	I thought I was doing a really good thing
11093	14513	and that I was really helping those kids.
14513	17219	I had a lot to learn.
17219	20039	It all started for me when I was 19 years old
20039	23043	and went backpacking through Southeast Asia.
23043	24742	When I reached Cambodia,
24742	29040	I felt uncomfortable being on holiday surrounded by so much poverty
29040	31875	and wanted to do something to give back.
31875	35617	So I visited some orphanages and donated some clothes and books
35617	36935	and some money
36935	39715	to help the kids that I met.
39715	43891	But one of the orphanages I visited was desperately poor.
43891	48165	I had never encountered poverty like that before in my life.
48165	50599	They didn't have funds for enough food,
50599	51933	clean water
51933	53949	or medical treatment,
53949	56871	and the sad little faces on those kids
56871	58730	were heartbreaking.
58730	62258	So I was compelled to do something more to help.
62258	65946	I fund-raised in Australia and returned to Cambodia the following year
65946	69375	to volunteer at the orphanage for a few months.
69375	72548	I taught English and bought water filters and food
72548	77487	and took all of the kids to the dentist for the first time in their lives.
77487	79424	But over the course of the next year,
79424	83032	I came to discover that this orphanage that I had been supporting
83032	85114	was terribly corrupt.
85114	89895	The director had been embezzling every cent donated to the orphanage,
89895	94269	and in my absence, the children were suffering such gross neglect
94269	98486	that they were forced to catch mice to feed themselves.
98486	99913	I also found out later
99913	104883	that the director had been physically and sexually abusing the kids.
104883	107523	I couldn't bring myself to turn my back on children
107523	110209	who I had come to know and care about
110209	113161	and return to my life in Australia.
113161	116722	So I worked with a local team and the local authorities
116722	120125	to set up a new orphanage and rescue the kids
120125	124221	to give them a safe new home.
124221	128950	But this is where my story takes another unexpected turn.
128950	134995	As I adjusted to my new life running an orphanage in Cambodia,
134995	138977	(Khmer) I learned to speak Khmer fluently,
138977	142524	which means that I learned to speak the Khmer language fluently.
142524	145599	And when I could communicate properly with the kids,
145599	149697	I began to uncover some strange things.
149697	153386	Most of the children we had removed from the orphanage
153386	158013	were not, in fact, orphans at all.
158013	160547	They had parents,
160547	163942	and the few that were orphaned had other living relatives,
163942	166486	like grandparents and aunties and uncles
166486	168885	and other siblings.
168885	173341	So why were these children living in an orphanage
173341	177277	when they weren't orphans?
177277	180535	Since 2005, the number of orphanages in Cambodia
180535	183776	has risen by 75 percent,
183776	186895	and the number of children living in Cambodian orphanages
186895	189065	has nearly doubled,
189065	190601	despite the fact
190601	193748	that the vast majority of children living in these orphanages
193748	197277	are not orphans in the traditional sense.
197277	200891	They're children from poor families.
200891	203845	So if the vast majority of children living in orphanages
203845	205292	are not orphans,
205292	207178	then the term "orphanage"
207178	212561	is really just a euphemistic name for a residential care institution.
212561	215518	These institutions go by other names as well,
215518	221027	like "shelters," "safe houses," "children's homes," "children's villages,"
221027	223430	even "boarding schools."
223430	228451	And this problem is not just confined to Cambodia.
228451	232266	This map shows some of the countries that have seen a dramatic increase
232266	235125	in the numbers of residential care institutions
235125	239807	and the numbers of children being institutionalized.
239807	241238	In Uganda, for example,
241238	243851	the number of children living in institutions
243851	250589	has increased by more than 1,600 percent since 1992.
250589	255033	And the problems posed by putting kids into institutions
255033	259732	don't just pertain to the corrupt and abusive institutions
259732	262411	like the one that I rescued the kids from.
262411	267929	The problems are with all forms of residential care.
267929	271959	Over 60 years of international research has shown us
271959	275299	that children who grow up in institutions,
275299	278267	even the very best institutions,
278267	281795	are at serious risk of developing mental illnesses,
281795	283602	attachment disorders,
283602	285857	growth and speech delays,
285857	288845	and many will struggle with an inability to reintegrate
288845	291081	back into society later in life
291081	294826	and form healthy relationships as adults.
294826	298038	These kids grow up without any model of family
298038	300509	or of what good parenting looks like,
300509	304784	so they then can struggle to parent their own children.
304784	308925	So if you institutionalize large numbers of children,
308925	312486	it will affect not only this generation,
312486	316546	but also the generations to come.
316546	320061	We've learned these lessons before in Australia.
320061	323910	It's what happened to our "Stolen Generations,"
323910	327592	the indigenous children who were removed from their families
327592	330037	with the belief that we could do a better job
330037	333962	of raising their children.
333962	335509	Just imagine for a moment
335509	339023	what residential care would be like for a child.
339023	342205	Firstly, you have a constant rotation of caregivers,
342205	345919	with somebody new coming on to the shift every eight hours.
345919	349146	And then on top of that you have a steady stream of visitors
349146	350932	and volunteers coming in,
350932	355221	showering you in the love and affection you're craving
355221	357337	and then leaving again,
357337	360263	evoking all of those feelings of abandonment,
360263	363559	and proving again and again
363559	367655	that you are not worthy of being loved.
367655	373477	We don't have orphanages in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,
373477	376355	and for a very good reason:
376355	379948	one study has shown that young adults raised in institutions
379948	384478	are 10 times more likely to fall into sex work than their peers,
384478	388766	40 times more likely to have a criminal record,
388766	392892	and 500 times more likely
392892	396803	to take their own lives.
396803	401531	There are an estimated eight million children around the world
401531	404579	living in institutions like orphanages,
404579	409803	despite the fact that around 80 percent of them are not orphans.
409803	412808	Most have families who could be caring for them
412808	416246	if they had the right support.
416246	418155	But for me,
418155	421505	the most shocking thing of all to realize
421505	424181	is what's contributing to this boom
424181	431364	in the unnecessary institutionalization of so many children:
431364	433756	it's us --
433756	437514	the tourists, the volunteers
437514	439963	and the donors.
439963	445458	It's the well-meaning support from people like me back in 2006,
445458	449351	who visit these children and volunteer and donate,
449351	454474	who are unwittingly fueling an industry that exploits children
454474	457941	and tears families apart.
457941	461743	It's really no coincidence that these institutions are largely set up
461743	464679	in areas where tourists can most easily be lured in
464679	469924	to visit and volunteer in exchange for donations.
469924	474049	Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,
474049	480402	over 90 percent of them are located in the most popular tourist hotspots.
480402	482639	The cold, hard truth is,
482639	487006	the more money that floods in in support of these institutions,
487006	489895	the more institutions open
489895	493065	and the more children are removed from their families
493065	495235	to fill their beds.
495235	500614	It's just the laws of supply and demand.
500614	503775	I had to learn all of these lessons the hard way,
503775	508477	after I had already set up an orphanage in Cambodia.
508477	512469	I had to eat a big piece of humble pie to admit
512469	514898	that I had made a mistake
514898	518814	and inadvertently become a part of the problem.
518814	521166	I had been an orphanage tourist,
521166	523051	a voluntourist.
523051	528058	I then set up my own orphanage and facilitated orphanage tourism
528058	531461	in order to generate funds for my orphanage,
531461	534375	before I knew better.
534375	536407	What I came to learn
536407	539841	is that no matter how good my orphanage was,
539841	545949	it was never going to give those kids what they really needed:
545949	549298	their families.
549298	552341	I know that it can feel incredibly depressing
552341	556120	to learn that helping vulnerable children and overcoming poverty
556120	560921	is not as simple as we've all been led to believe it should be.
560921	564664	But thankfully, there is a solution.
564664	568486	These problems are reversible and preventable,
568486	570524	and when we know better,
570524	573093	we can do better.
573093	575465	The organization that I run today,
575465	577761	the Cambodian Children's Trust,
577761	580435	is no longer an orphanage.
580435	587071	In 2012, we changed the model in favor of family-based care.
587071	590886	I now lead an amazing team of Cambodian social workers,
590886	592983	nurses and teachers.
592983	595412	Together, we work within communities
595412	598750	to untangle a complex web of social issues
598750	602775	and help Cambodian families escape poverty.
602775	606957	Our primary focus is on preventing some of the most vulnerable families
606957	608142	in our community
608142	611494	from being separated in the first place.
611494	613551	But in cases where it's not possible
613551	616829	for a child to live with its biological family,
616829	620170	we support them in foster care.
620170	623861	Family-based care is always better
623861	628473	than placing a child in an institution.
628473	632055	Do you remember that first photo that I showed you before?
632055	635222	See that girl who is just about to catch the ball?
635222	637463	Her name is Torn
637463	641337	She's a strong, brave and fiercely intelligent girl.
641337	644256	But in 2006, when I first met her
644256	648049	living in that corrupt and abusive orphanage,
648049	650373	she had never been to school.
650373	653137	She was suffering terrible neglect,
653137	655997	and she yearned desperately
655997	660534	for the warmth and love of her mother.
660534	664642	But this is a photo of Torn today with her family.
664642	667080	Her mother now has a secure job,
667080	669628	her siblings are doing well in high school
669628	674108	and she is just about to finish her nursing degree at university.
674108	675703	For Torn's family --
675703	684237	(Applause)
684237	685666	for Torn's family,
685666	689271	the cycle of poverty has been broken.
689271	692967	The family-based care model that we have developed at CCT
692967	694800	has been so successful,
694800	698202	that it's now being put forward by UNICEF Cambodia
698202	699742	and the Cambodian government
699742	705116	as a national solution to keep children in families.
705116	706901	And one of the best --
706901	712664	(Applause)
712664	717030	And one of the best ways that you can help to solve this problem
717030	720850	is by giving these eight million children a voice
720850	724538	and become an advocate for family-based care.
724538	727664	If we work together to raise awareness,
727664	730524	we can make sure the world knows
730524	735656	that we need to put an end to the unnecessary institutionalization
735656	738153	of vulnerable children.
738153	740194	How do we achieve that?
740194	744045	By redirecting our support and our donations
744045	748395	away from orphanages and residential care institutions
748395	755564	towards organizations that are committed to keeping children in families.
755564	759007	I believe we can make this happen in our lifetime,
759007	762674	and as a result, we will see developing communities thrive
762674	765891	and ensure that vulnerable children everywhere
765891	770648	have what all children need and deserve:
770648	772059	a family.
772059	773263	Thank you.
773263	773263	(Applause)
